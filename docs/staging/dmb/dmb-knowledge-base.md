```{admonition} Sally's note
This page should not go into the docs in its current format. Any knowledge that
should be kept should find appropriate pages to live on (can be new pages).

I have only changed the formatting, corrected some minor spelling errors and
updated links to point to internal references where the original wiki link points
to a wiki page that has been moved already. The wording of the content is the
same as the wiki page.
```

This page is intended to list all of the miscellaneous pieces of DMB knowledge
that have accumulated over the years.

This page is authoritative. If you think you've found a mistake, please

## Actions after a successful application

1. Assign two meeting actions: one to make ACL changes, and one to announce
   the successful applicant. This is to make sure that the announcement does not
   get forgotten.

2. Adjust ACLs

     1. (The part of this section moved to {ref}`dmb-manage-packagesets`)

     2. (The part of this section moved to {ref}`dmb-manage-packagesets`)

     3. Email `technical-board@lists.ubuntu.com` to inform them of the opened
        bug (include a link to the bug).

     4. Add the new TB bug to the [DMB agenda](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-developer-membership-board-agenda/66634)
        in the "Open TB bugs" section.

     5. After the new packageset is created by the TB, a DMB member will need to
        add the appropriate packages.

3. (This part of this section moved to {ref}`dmb-manage-packagesets`)

4. Announce successful applicants (this can be done in a single email or multiple
   emails as appropriate), as the Community Council
   [would like to see these announced](https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2016/07/21/%23ubuntu-meeting.html#t17:17)
   and [we agreed in a subsequent meeting](https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2016/08/01/%23ubuntu-meeting.html#t16:02).

   Send emails to:

   * A reply to the original `devel-permissions@lists.ubuntu.com` thread (useful
      for future reference)

   * An email to `ubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com`

   * An email to `ubuntu-news-team@lists.ubuntu.com`

5. Remove the applicant's agenda item if it is still present.


### Actions after an unsuccessful application

Assign a meeting action to close the application. Closing an application involves:

* Reply with regrets to the `devel-permissions@lists.ubuntu.com` thread only
  (useful for future reference when the applicant reapplies, and to make it
  clear that voting is complete).

* Remove the applicant's agenda item if it is still present.


## out of context now

   * If applying for {ref}`dmb-joining-contributing` membership, the
     applicant should only be added to the
     [`~ubuntu-developer-members`](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-developer-members)
     team and nothing more.

### Delegating packageset uploader permissions

The DMB can decide to delegate the granting of upload rights to a packageset to
a different group of developers. An example is that the Ubuntu Desktop team is
self-managed. This means that applicants to that packageset do not come to the
DMB, but they come to the team itself instead. The procedure is the same as for
most other applications: somebody approaches the DMB with the proposal and it is
voted on at the meeting. If approved, the body delegated should be added as an
administrator of the team. It is very important that the teams come with a
policy that says how applications will be managed. That is the document which
you approve. You can see some examples on {ref}`dmb`, and it is important that
this list is kept current.


## SRU Developers

Based on [this thread](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2017-February/039652.html),
[the DMB agreed](https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2017/02/27/%23ubuntu-meeting.html#t19:32)
to create [a new team for SRU developers](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sru-developers).
This was [announced to ubuntu-devel on 28 February 2017](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2017-February/039702.html).
See {ref}`dmb-joining-sru-dev` for details.

This team is for contributors who work mostly on SRUs but don't necessarily yet
have experience in wider Ubuntu development. Team membership allows the sponsors
to get out of the way for SRUs only.

This team grants Ubuntu Membership. In other words, the DMB must determine that
an applicant meets the requirements for Ubuntu Membership before granting an
applicant membership of this team.

Add successful applicants to the [`~ubuntu-sru-developers`](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sru-developers)
team.


### Removals

There was some concern about potential bad uploads bothering the SRU team, so to
mitigate this the DMB also agreed that individual `~ubuntu-sru-developers`
membership will be removed if any of:

* `~ubuntu-sru` resolves to remove the member (how they do so is up to them); or
* The DMB resolves to remove the member by a quorate vote, and a vote will be
  held if any member of `~ubuntu-sru` requests it.


(dmb-teams-to-add-uploaders-to)=
## Teams to add uploaders to

By default, uploaders to packagesets and per-package uploaders should be granted
membership. This does **not** happen automatically -- they must be added to the
`~ubuntu-dev` team. The reason for this is that occasionally the DMB may want to
grant people upload rights if they do not meet the usual "significant and
sustained" (interpreted as 6 months of contributions). That is: **when adding a
new packageset or PPU uploader, add the individual to `~ubuntu-dev` if they are
being granted membership or (for PPU only) to `~ubuntu-uploaders` if they are
not**.

An exception to the above is that some packagesets *require* membership. You can
identify these because the uploading teams are a member of `~ubuntu-dev` instead
of `~ubuntu-uploaders`. In these cases applicants must satisfy the membership
criteria: granting upload rights without membership is not possible.

This is, of course, only the case when adding **uploaders**. Memberships such
as for {ref}`dmb-joining-contributing`, which do not grant any upload
rights to the Ubuntu Archive, do not require adding the new members to any of
the above teams. Those should only be added to
[`~ubuntu-developer-members`](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-developer-members).



## Accidental expiry

Since we usually require uploaders to self-renew after some period, sometimes
this is missed by an uploader, and they request that we reinstate them shortly
after expiry.

The DMB have long established that if it's relatively soon after expiry in the
judgement of an individual DMB member, then the uploader can have their
membership reinstated without any further consideration.

If it has been some considerable time since the uploader's team membership
expired, then a full DMB vote is required as usual, but the DMB has in the past
opted not to require a full application (just an agenda item and a quick
discussion at the next meeting).

For the "relatively soon" case, the DMB member should use the following process:

1. Make sure the request is available in the archives of `devel-permissions@`

2. Go to the "Members" page on Launchpad for the team in question (e.g.
   [`~ubuntu-core-dev` members](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/+members))

3. Page to the end to locate the "Former members" section and locate the uploader.

4. Check the "Expired on" date in the "Status" column is relatively recent. If
   it is not, then stop this process here and ask that the applicant attends a
   DMB meeting to request reinstatement as discussed above.

5. Using the {guilabel}`Edit` button on the right of the former team member
   entry, change "Expiration" to "On" using the default date provided, write a
   suitable comment, and click the {guilabel}`Renew` button.

6. Reply to the `devel-permissions@` thread confirming renewal so there is a
   record in the Archive.
