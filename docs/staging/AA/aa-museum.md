## The museum

This section houses all the content which is no longer up-to-date, but might
still be of historical interest. All of this content is now deprecated and
you should refer to the main {ref}`archive-administration` documentation.


### Useful runes

This section contains some copy-and-paste shell tricks to ease recurring jobs.

#### reprocess-failed-to-move

In some cases, binary packages fail to move from the incoming queue to the
accepted queue. To fix this, run: `~lp_buildd/reprocess-failed-to-move` as
`lp_buildd`


#### Reprocessing failed source uploads

If a source upload fails for spurious/transient reasons (you can check in
`pepo:/srv/launchpad.net/production-logs/lp_queue/process-upload.log`), ask
webops to locate the appropriate `upload-*` directory and corresponding
`.distro` file in `/srv/launchpad.net/ubuntu-queue/` (they will probably be in
either `failed` or `rejected`) and move them both back to
`/srv/launchpad.net/ubuntu-queue/incoming/`.



### Other archives

[`extras.ubuntu.com`](https://extras.ubuntu.com/) is not managed by the Ubuntu
Archive Administration team, but is a PPA owned by the
[Application Review Board](https://launchpad.net/~app-review-board).



### Useful web pages

Equally useful to the tools are the various auto-generated web pages in
`ubuntu-archive`'s `public_html` that can give you a feel for the state of the
Archive.

* [`component-mismatches.txt`](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/component-mismatches.txt)

  As described above, this lists the differences between the Archive and the
  output of the {ref}`germinate` script. It shows up packages that are in the
  wrong place, or need seeding.

* [`germinate-output`](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/germinate-output/)

  This is the output of the `germinate` script, split up into each release of
  each flavour of Ubuntu. 

* [`priority-mismatches.txt`](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/priority-mismatches.txt)

  Shows discrepancies between priorities of packages and where they probably
  should go according to the seeds.

* [`architecture-mismatches.txt`](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/architecture-mismatches.txt)

  Shows override discrepancies between architectures, which are generally bugs.

* [`http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/testing/xenial_probs.html`](http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/testing/xenial_probs.html)

  Generated by the half-hourly run of `britney` and indicates packages that are
  uninstallable on Xenial, usually due to missing dependencies or problematic
  conflicts. **note, this link 404s**

* [`http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/testing/xenial_outdate.html`](http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/testing/xenial_outdate.html)

  Lists differences between binary and source versions in the Archive. This
  often shows up both build failures (where binaries are out of date for
  particular architectures) but also where a binary is
  No longer Built from the Source. **note, this link 404s**

* [`~ubuntu-archive/NBS/`](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/NBS/) and [`~ubuntu-archive/nbs.html`](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/nbs.html)

  This contains a list of binary packages which are Not Built from Source (NBS)
  any more. The files contain the list of reverse dependencies of those packages
  (output of `checkrdepends -b`). These packages need to be removed eventually,
  thus all reverse dependencies need to be fixed. This is updated half-hourly.




(chroot-management)=
### Chroot management

```{important}
Please note that chroot management is something generally handled by Canonical
IS (and specifically by Adam Conrad). The following section documents the
procedures required should one have to, for instance, remove all the chroots
for a certain suite to stop the build queue in its tracks while a breakage is
hunted down and fixed, but please don't take this as an open invitation to mess
with the `buildd` chroots at will.
```

Soyuz stores one chroot per (suite, architecture).

`manage-chroot` allows the following actions upon a specified chroot:

```bash
$ ./manage-chroot
Usage: manage-chroot -a ARCHITECTURE [options] <get|info|remove|set>

manage-chroot: error: You must specify an architecture.
```

Downloading (`get`) an existing chroot:

```bash
$ ./manage-chroot [-s SUITE] <-a ARCH> get
```

The chroot will be downloaded and stored in the local disk name as
'`chroot-<DISTRIBUTION>-<SERIES>-<ARCHTAG>.tar.bz2`'.

Uploading (`add`/`update`) a new chroot:

```bash
$ ./manage-chroot [-s SUITE] <-a ARCH> set -f <CHROOT_FILE>
```

The new chroot will be immediately used for the next build job in the
corresponding architecture.

Disabling (`remove`) an existing chroot:

```
$ ./manage-chroot [-s SUITE] <-a ARCH> remove
```

```{important}
Unless you have plans for creating a new chroots from scratch, it's better to
download them to disk before the removal (`recover` is possible, but involves
direct DB access)
```

No builds will be dispatched for architectures with no chroot, the build-farm
will continue functional for the rest of the system.

### Useful tools

There are other useful tools in your `PATH` which are invaluable.



#### Publishing security uploads from the `ubuntu-security` private PPA

Security uploads in Soyuz are first built, published, and tested in the
Security Team's private PPA. To un-embargo them, the Security Team use a tool
that re-publishes them to the primary archive.
[This is now self-service](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdatePublication),
although you may occasionally be asked to adjust overrides, which can be done
in the usual way.



#### Publishing packages from the ubuntu-security-proposed public PPA to -proposed

This works the same as the `ubuntu-mozilla-security` PPA, above. E.g., using
`lp:ubuntu-qa-tools/security-tools/unembargo`:

```bash
$ unembargo --ppa=ubuntu-security-proposed -r xenial --pocket=proposed gnupg
```


#### Copying PPA kernels to -proposed

With the new
[Stable Release Cadence](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/StableReleaseCadence),
kernels are built in the
[Kernel Team PPA](https://launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel-team/+archive/ppa)
and then pocket copied to the proposed pocket in the main archive once they are
ACK-ed.

The two most useful URLs for this process are the
[Kernel SRU Report](http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/kernel-bugs/reports/sru-report.html),
where you will find links to the tracking bugs (the magnifying glasses), as well
as the status of each package in each release, and the
[Kernel SRU workflow](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/kernel-sru-workflow),
which outlines in fine detail how each bug task should be handled, what the
states mean, etc. The executive summary of the previous link is "only operate
on tasks assigned to your team, and only when they're in the *Confirmed* state,
and when you do, please reassign to yourself and set the task to *Fix Released*
when you're done".

The [Pending SRU report](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/pending-sru.html#kernelppa)
has a section for the kernel PPA which shows all newer kernels in the PPA,
provides click-able links to open all bugs (with separate CVE bugs), and
copy-and-paste-able `copy-proposed-kernel` and `sru-accept` commands (both in
`ubuntu-archive-tools`).

To publish `linux` version `2.6.32-27.49` from the `canonical-kernel-team` PPA
to the `-proposed` pocket of Ubuntu's `lucid` release, you would do the
following:

* Click on the "open bugs" button and check:

  * that the bugs are in a reasonable state, i.e. they target the right source package (e.g.
    `linux` vs. `linux-ec2`)
  
  * that the bugs are fixed in the development release (or at least upstream)

  * that the changes are limited to bug fixes, and are in general within the
    boundaries of the [Stable Release Updates policy](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates).
    They should ideally have a task for the stable release the SRU targets.
    Note that this button does not open CVE bugs, as they don't get verification
    or other tracking (there is a separate button for opening them, if desired).

* Find the tracking bug by either traversing through the list of bugs, or
  opening the `.changes` file and looking at the top (the release bug is pointed
  out there). Ensure that there is a proper stable task, and that the main
  (development release) task is invalid.

* Run the `copy-proposed-kernel` command to copy it to `-proposed`. Once the
  kernels are copied to `-proposed` and accepted, update the bug to close the
  "Promote-to-proposed" task and assign it to yourself.

  However, with some flavours like `-ec2` or `armel` kernels, which are mostly
  just a merge with the main `linux` kernel, it is too much overhead to add
  `-ec2` tasks to all the bugs.

* Due to current limitations of Launchpad, new packages copied from a PPA into
  the archive sometimes go to `universe`. As a result, please
  **verify the overrides for all packages** copied to `-proposed`, otherwise
  these packages might become uninstallable when they are ultimately copied to
  `-updates`/`-security`. `find-bin-overrides` from `lp:ubuntu-qa-tools` can
  help with this. You use it like so:
  
  ```bash
  find-bin-overrides <pocket to compare to> <target pocket> <ubuntu release> <source package>=<version in pocket to compare to>,<old abi>,<new abi>
  ```.
  
  E.g., suppose there is a new kernel in `hardy-proposed` with a new ABI of
  `2.6.24-30` and you want to get a list of overrides for the new kernel based
  on the old ABI of `2.6.24-16` in the `2.6.24.12-16.34` version from the
  `-release` pocket of Hardy. For the
  `linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24 source package`, you might use:
  
  ```bash
  $ find-bin-overrides release proposed hardy \
  linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24=2.6.24.12-16.34,2.6.24-16,2.6.24-30
  ## hardy/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24
  ./change-override -c multiverse -s hardy-proposed fglrx-kernel-source ...
  ./change-override -c restricted -s hardy-proposed avm-fritz-firmware-2.6.24-30 ...
  ```

  For the `linux` source package, you might use:

  ```bash
  $ find-bin-overrides release proposed hardy linux=2.6.24-16.30,2.6.24-16,2.6.24-30
  ## hardy/linux
  ...
  ```

  You may also specify `--show-main` to also show the the `change-override`
  command to move things to `main`. This can be useful if you know the overrides
  are very wrong. See `find-bin-overrides -h` for details.

**TODO:** A process/script similar to `kernel-overrides` should be developed to
make sure overrides are properly handled for binaries not in `main`. Is
`find-bin-overrides` from `lp:ubuntu-qa-tools` good enough?


#### Copying security uploads to -updates

Security uploads are distributed from a single system, `security.ubuntu.com`
(consisting of one or a small number of machines in the Canonical datacenter).
While this ensures much quicker distribution of security updates than is
possible from a mirror network, it places a very high load on the machines
serving `security.ubuntu.com`, as well as inflating Canonical's bandwidth
expenses very substantially. Every new installation of a stable release of
Ubuntu is likely to be shortly followed by downloading all security updates to
date, which is a significant ongoing cost.

To mitigate this, we periodically copy security uploads to the `-updates`
pocket, which is distributed via the regular mirror network. In fact, the pooled
packages associated with `-security` are mirrored too, but mirrored `-security`
entries are not in the default `/etc/apt/sources.list` to avoid causing even
more HTTP requests on every `apt-get update`. This is a cheap operation, and has
no effect on the timely distribution of security updates, other than to reduce
the load on central systems.

The `copy-report` tool lists all security uploads that need to be copied to
`-updates`. If the package in question is not already in `-updates`, it can be
copied without further checks. Otherwise, `copy-report` will extract the
changelogs (which may take a little while) and confirm that the package in
`-security` is a descendant of the package in `-updates`. If that is not the
case, it will report that the package needs to be merged by hand.

The output of the tool looks like this:

```bash
$ ./copy-report
The following packages can be copied safely:
--------------------------------------------

copy-package -y -b -s feisty-security --to-suite feisty-updates -e 8.3.5-6ubuntu2.1 tk8.3
copy-package -y -b -s feisty-security --to-suite feisty-updates -e 8.4.14-0ubuntu2.1 tk8.4
```

The block of output under "The following packages can be copied safely:" may be
copied and pasted in its entirety (or run `copy-report --safe`). If there is a
block headed "The following packages need to be merged by hand:", then make
sure that the security team is aware of those cases.

Note that `copy-report --safe` is run from a cron job as the `ubuntu-archive`
user on `ubuntu-archive-toolbox`, and so does not typically need to be run by
hand.


#### Handling updates to partner

Updates to the partner archive follow a similar process as packages in the
Ubuntu archive. Specifically, packages are first built in the `-proposed`
pocket, then they need to be copied to the `-release` pocket after they are
built and then cleaned up from the `-proposed` pocket. The process is as follows
(examples show `adobe-flashplugin` being updated for Xenial):

1. Review the package in the "unapproved" queue, and if appropriate, accept the
   package into partner for the `-proposed` pocket (in this example, `-proposed`
   for Xenial)

1. When the package builds on all architectures, copy it to the partner release
   pocket (this makes it available to users). E.g.:

  ```bash
  $ ./copy-package -b --auto-approve --from=ubuntu/partner -s xenial-proposed --to-suite xenial adobe-flashplugin
  ```

  or to do all at once:

  ```bash
  $ for i in xenial bionic focal groovy; do ./copy-package -b --auto-approve --from=ubuntu/partner -s $i-proposed --to-suite $i adobe-flashplugin ; done
  ```

1. Remove the package from proposed in the partner archive. E.g.:

  ```bash
  $ ./remove-package -A ubuntu/partner -m "copied to release" -s xenial-proposed adobe-flashplugin
  ```

  or to do all at once:

  ```bash
  $ for i in xenial bionic focal groovy; do ./remove-package -A ubuntu/partner -m "copied to release" -s $i-proposed adobe-flashplugin ; done
  ```

This stuff was already old in the old wiki. This will be deleted outright as it
has either been replaced or folded into other sections.

### Syncs

Syncing packages with Debian used to be a reasonably common request. It is now
self-service for developers using `syncpackage`. If you are asked to process a
sync in the old style, you can use the `-s` option to `syncpackage` to do so in
the name of the requester.

Most updates available in Debian are automatically synced before
[Debian Import Freeze](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebianImportFreeze), but packages
that were previously in Ubuntu will not be automatically reintroduced. To
process these interactively:

```bash
$ ./auto-sync --new-only
```

To sync from any source that is not automatically imported by Launchpad, use
the `syncpackage` tool on a `.dsc` file. Any uploader can do this; it does not
require being an Archive Administrator.

Likewise, backports are now self-service for members of
[`ubuntu-backporters`](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-backporters) using
`backportpackage`.

### Useful tools

There are other useful tools in your `PATH` which are invaluable.


#### Archive state checks

`rmadison` (in the `devscripts` package, run on your client system) examines
the current state of the archive for a given binary/source package:

```bash
$ rmadison dpkg
      dpkg | 1.10.22ubuntu2 |         warty | source, amd64, i386, powerpc
      dpkg | 1.10.22ubuntu2.1 | warty-security | source, amd64, i386, powerpc
      dpkg | 1.10.27ubuntu1 |         hoary | source, amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc
      dpkg | 1.10.27ubuntu1.1 | hoary-security | source, amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc
      dpkg | 1.10.27ubuntu2 | hoary-updates | source, amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc
      dpkg | 1.13.10ubuntu4 |        breezy | source, amd64, hppa, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc
      dpkg | 1.13.11ubuntu5 |        dapper | source, amd64, hppa, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc
```

```bash
$ rmadison dselect
   dselect | 1.10.22ubuntu2 |         warty | amd64, i386, powerpc
   dselect | 1.10.22ubuntu2.1 | warty-security | amd64, i386, powerpc
   dselect | 1.10.27ubuntu1 |         hoary | amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc
   dselect | 1.10.27ubuntu1.1 | hoary-security | amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc
   dselect | 1.10.27ubuntu2 | hoary-updates | amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc
   dselect | 1.13.10ubuntu4 |        breezy | amd64, hppa, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc
   dselect | 1.13.11ubuntu5 |        dapper | amd64, hppa, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc
```

Or when used with `-S` and a source package, the source and every binary built
by it:

```bash
$ rmadison -S dpkg
      dpkg | 1.10.22ubuntu2 |         warty | source, amd64, i386, powerpc
      dpkg | 1.10.22ubuntu2.1 | warty-security | source, amd64, i386, powerpc
      dpkg | 1.10.27ubuntu1 |         hoary | source, amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc, sparc

```

`checkrdepends` lists the reverse dependencies of a given binary:

```bash
$ checkrdepends -s zesty -b nm-applet
```

or source package:

```bash
$ checkrdepends -s zesty network-manager
```


#### NEW handling

A lot of churn in NEW comes from Debian imports. Since they already went
through NEW in Debian, we should not waste too much time on it, so there are
some tools.

* The first thing you need to handle are native syncs. These are syncs
  performed via URLs like
  [`https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/zesty/+localpackagediffs`](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/zesty/+localpackagediffs)
  or via the Launchpad API. You can recognize these in the LP queue pages
  because they have '(sync)' in the name. In `queue info`, they show up as
  '`X-`' (as opposed to '`S-`' like normal source uploads). There are no changes
  files for these, so they cannot currently be fetched via `queue fetch`. To
  verify a native sync:

  1. Download the source package from Debian (e.g. via `dget` or
     `apt-get source <pkg>=<version>`)

  1. Download the imported `dsc` file from the Debian project in LP, e.g.
     [`https://launchpad.net/debian/sid/+source/pxe-kexec`](https://launchpad.net/debian/sid/+source/pxe-kexec)

  1. Compare the `dsc` file from Debian and from LP. Since both should be
     signed, if they are identical, then you know the package hasn't been
     tampered with. You can also compare the full source package from Debian and
     LP if desired.

  Once verified, accept it normally via LP or `./queue accept <srcpkg>`.

* `./new-binary-debian-universe` accepts all binary NEW packages whose source
  was imported from Debian and is in `universe`. With the `--lintian` option,
  it runs `lintian` over all the imported `.debs` while it runs, so you can
  watch the output and note all particularly worrisome issues. When you are
  happy, say "yes" at each confirmation prompt.

* When unpacking a source package for source NEW checks, you should run
  `suspicious-source`. This is basically a `find -type f` which ignores all
  files with a known-safe name (such as `*.c`, `configure`, `*.glade`). Every
  file that it outputs should be checked for being the preferred form of
  modification, as required by the {term}`GPL`. This makes it easier to spot
  PDFs and other binary-only files that are not accompanied by a source. The
  `licensecheck` command is also useful for verifying the license status of
  source packages.


#### Moving packages to -updates

Packages in `-proposed` can be moved to `-updates` once they are approved by
someone from `sru-verification`, and have passed the minimum aging period of
**7 days**. Use the `sru-release` script from `ubuntu-archive-tools` for this:

```bash
$ ./sru-release xenial kdebase
```

Please see `--help`, you can also use this tool to copy packages to `-security`
and to the current development release.

```{note}
Before copying a package to `-security` ping a member of the
[ubuntu-security](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+members) team.
```

* [Currently pending SRUs](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/pending-sru.html)



#### Publishing packages from the `ubuntu-mozilla-security` public PPA

Mozilla (Firefox and Thunderbird) uploads in Soyuz are first built, published,
and tested in the Mozilla Security Team's public PPA. To publish them into the
`main` archive, use `copy-package` from `ubuntu-archive-tools`.

Note that pocket copies to the `-security` pocket should never be done without
an explicit request from a member of the Ubuntu Security Team (Mozilla Security
Team is not enough), and copies to the `-proposed` pocket should not be done
without an explicit request from a member of the SRU Team. Keep in mind that
`firefox` 2.0 and later (i.e. Hardy and later) will always have a corresponding
`xulrunner` package that needs copying.

To publish `firefox` version `22.0+build2-0ubuntu0.12.04.2` from the
`ubuntu-mozilla-security` PPA to the `-security` pocket of Ubuntu's `precise`
release, you would do the following:

```bash
$ ./copy-package -b --from=~ubuntu-mozilla-security/ubuntu/ppa -s precise --to=ubuntu --to-suite precise-security -e 22.0+build2-0ubuntu0.12.04.2 firefox
```

Alternatively, can use `lp:ubuntu-qa-tools/security-tools/unembargo` like so:

```bash
$ unembargo --ppa=ubuntu-mozilla-security -r xenial --pocket=proposed chromium-browser
```



#### Other copies

`copy-package` is a versatile tool and can be used for a number of other
purposes. If you are doing something not documented here, please ask on
`#ubuntu-release` first.

Archive Administrators technically (as in, per the ACLs) have the ability to
copy into the `RELEASE` pocket of the current development series. Please do not
do this; that pocket is owned by the
[proposed-migration](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/)
tools, and those tools have built-in override facilities for the cases where
they are wrong.

The [release team has access](https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-release/britney/hints-ubuntu)
to apply such overrides when needed.




### Archive Administration shifts

This is a next try for establishing Archive Admin shifts during the week.
During an AA shift, an Archive Admin allocates at least 2 hours to work on
tasks requiring special `ubuntu-archive` permissions.

Current members with regular admin shifts are:

* Monday:
* Tuesday: 
* Wednesday: `sil2100` (9:00--11:00 UTC)
* Thursday: `seb128` (10--12 CET)
* Friday: 

On an archive shift, the following items should be the main focus:

* Stay open for any `ubuntu-archive` IRC requests, being available to help
  developers out with their everyday work

Additionally, performing the following should be considered:

* Process [pending archive bugs](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-archive/+subscribedbugs).
  This query often generates a Launchpad OOPS rather than succeeding;
  [This query](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.subscriber=ubuntu-archive&field.status=NEW&field.status=Confirmed&field.status=Triaged&field.status=INPROGRESS&field.status=FIXCOMMITTED&field.status=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&orderby=-id&start=0)
  is more likely to succeed, but might miss some bugs. Most of those are syncs,
  removals, component fixes, but there might be other (less common) requests.

* Process the NEW queues of the current development release and `*-backports`
  of all supported stable releases.

* If we are not yet in the
  [Debian Import Freeze](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebianImportFreeze), run
  `process-removals` to review/remove packages that were removed in Debian.

* Clean up component-mismatches, and poke people to fix dependencies/write MIRs.

* Remove NBS packages without reverse dependencies, and prod maintainers to

### Outdated

```{admonition} Question
:class: important
This section is actually marked on the AA page as being outdated. Should we
keep it for historical interest?
```

#### Logging in

Outdated: this is now on `ubuntu-archive-toolbox.internal` and works completely
differently.

A few operations still require direct SSH access to `pepo.canonical.com`;
accounts are provided to some members of the team. (We are
[transitioning away from direct shell access](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FoundationsTeam/ReplaceArchiveAdminShellAccess),
so new team members will not get accounts here, thereby encouraging us to
complete the transition more quickly). Changes can only be made as the
`lp_archive` user, to which you'll have `sudo` access.

So to begin:

```
$ ssh pepo
$ sudo -u lp_archive -i
```

The `-i` is important as `lp_archive`'s `.bashrc` sets the right environment
variables and makes sure the directory with all of the tools is placed in the
`PATH`.
