# About the MIR role

The [Ubuntu MIR team](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mir) oversees the Main
Inclusion Review (MIR) process. They are responsible for reviewing packages for
promotion:

* from {term}`universe` to {term}`main`
* from {term}`multiverse` to {term}`restricted`

To find out more about the Main Inclusion Review process, see the
{ref}`MIR overview <main-inclusion-review>`.

In the full {ref}`MIR process <main-inclusion-review>` there are more roles
involved than just the [Ubuntu MIR team](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mir),
see {ref}`mir-roles` about that.

## Communication

Preferably join and participate in the weekly {ref}`mir-team-meeting`
where you can raise issues or discuss your case with the team.

At other times, but with no guarantee that a majority of the team will
be available, you might join and ask in the
[Ubuntu Main inclusion requests](https://matrix.to/#/#ubuntu-mir:ubuntu.com)
channel.

## Service Level Objectives

The {ref}`Service Level Objectives <mir-slo>` page details what you can and
should expect from the reviewers.
