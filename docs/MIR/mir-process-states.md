# Process states

The {ref}`overview <main-inclusion-review>` aims to clarify and provide an easy
simplified entry to the topic. This page instead outlines the detailed
meaning of all MIR related bug states. This allows one to understand the
implications of such states and indicates the next course of action based on
an MIR bug's current state.

| State                                                       | Explanation |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| *1.* New / Confirmed[^1] (unassigned)                       | Bug is queued for assignment to an MIR team member |
| *2.* New / Confirmed[^1] (assigned to MIR team member)      | On the TODO list of the assigned MIR team member |
| *3.* New / Confirmed[^1] (assigned to Security team member) | On the TODO list of the Security team member |
| *4.* In Progress                                            | MIR team ACK (and if needed, Security team ACK) done, but now needs the Dependency / Seed change to happen to pull package(s) into `main`/`restricted` |
| *5.* Fix Committed                                          | All of the above done; waiting for an Archive Admin to promote the package(s) to `main`/`restricted` |
| *6.* Fix Released                                           | Case resolved by an Archive Admin |
| *7.* Won\'t Fix                                             | Final NACK from MIR team or bug reporter gave up |
| *8.* Incomplete                                             | Questions / Requests were raised for the bug reporter to resolve / clarify |
| *9.* Invalid[^1]                                            | No response within 60 days when in `Incomplete` state |
| *10.* Invalid[^1]                                           | Not promoted to main by owning-team 2 years after MIR approval |

[^1]: Since many people set Launchpad bugs to `Confirmed` once they verified 
     the validity of a problem, MIR bugs often get set to `Confirmed`. Since 
     `Confirmed` does not have any meaning for our process, we will handle
     `New` and `Confirmed` as if they are the same.


```{note}
All other states are undefined and should be resolved to one of the defined
states -– otherwise they might be completely missed on the weekly checks.
```

```{hint}
Transitioning from *2.*/*3.* to *4.*/*5.*/*8.*: The successor of assigned `New`
states depends *(as seen by multiple arrows in the state diagram)* on the
package(s) current state in the archive: 
* A NACK from the MIR or Security team will result in the `7. Won't Fix` state.
  A former reviewer will get unassigned. (If there is context to believe that 
  there might be a follow up by the reporter the reviewer might remain assigned.)
* In case of an ACK from the MIR team (and, if required the Security team), if 
  the package(s) is/are already tried to be pulled into `main`/`restricted` 
  then the next state is `5. (Fix Committed)`, otherwise the next state is 
  `4. In Progress`. Seen in:
  * [component mismatches for `main`/`restricted`](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/component-mismatches.svg) 
  * [component mismatches for `proposed`](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/component-mismatches-proposed.svg)
