# Handling MIR reviews

As part of the {ref}`main-inclusion-review` the {ref}`MIR Team <about-mir-role>`
reviews cases that have been {ref}`submitted <mir-submit-bug>`. To do so they
use the {ref}`mir-reviewers-template` alongside the general
{ref}`guidance on using such templates <mir-how-to-use-templates>`.

Furthermore they drive the {ref}`mir-team-meeting` for coordination of efforts
any related discussions.
