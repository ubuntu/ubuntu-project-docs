Ubuntu Local Communities, often shortened to LoCos, are regional teams that help advocate, promote, translate, develop and otherwise improve Ubuntu. 

With the incredible success of Ubuntu around the world, the Ubuntu Local Communities program was formed to help Ubuntu fans and enthusiasts work together.  Our worldwide network of LoCo teams are an important staple in the Ubuntu ecosystem and provide a strong backbone to our already vast and extensive Ubuntu community.
