# Starting a Local Community

Welcome! We're thrilled that you're interested in starting an Ubuntu Local Community.
Starting a new Local Community may sound difficult, but all it takes is a passion for Ubuntu and a desire to share it with others around you.
This guide is meant to help you get a Local Community up and running in your region with a number of useful tools and resources.


## Setting up communications

Communication is key when it comes to running a Local Community.
Canonical and the Ubuntu community provide a number of tools and services to help our Local Community leaders do what they do best.


### Ubuntu Community Portal

[The Ubuntu Community Portal](https://ubuntu.com/community) is the gateway into the Ubuntu Community and aggregates events, Local Communities, news, documentation like this and more from around the Ubuntu ecosystem.
The majority of the content from the portal is dynamically sourced from our Discourse server which you'll learn how to tap into in the next section.


### Ubuntu Discourse

[The Ubuntu Discourse](https://discourse.ubuntu.com), which we refer to as the 'Community Hub', is a powerful forum platform where Ubuntu community members come together to collaborate, discuss projects and support one another.
Content on the Discourse is broken down into categories, including one for Ubuntu Local Communities.

1. [Sign up for a Discourse account](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/auth/saml?signup=true) (and Ubuntu One account if you haven't already).
2. Once you're logged in, head over to The [Ubuntu Local Communities section](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/129) and see if a category already exists for your region.
   If not, you can request one by [filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7auchvVzpkH_cQdUFiiRcyGHtrSrGG0GmeQXaKkDhXVpsmw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=101065845149003260161).


### Ubuntu Matrix server

Local communities may also want a means of instant communication.
The Ubuntu community, along with a number of other open source communities, have opted for the open source Matrix protocol for their synchronous communication needs.
To get started using Matrix check out the following guides:

1. {ref}`Getting Started with Matrix <matrix-onboarding>` -- Will show you how to install and use the Element App, getting your personal Matrix account setup, and how to connect to the Ubuntu Matrix server.
2. {ref}`Creating a public room <matrix-room-creation-public>` -- Will walk you through creating a public room for your local community to use and converse on.


## Create and hosting events

Events are where your community comes to life.
They can be online or in person, formal or casual.


### Choose a venue

Perhaps the biggest challenge when it comes to hosting a local community meetup is where to actually meetup!
Generally, it's a good idea to find a place that's both affordable and accessible.
Some excellent options include:

* Universities and trade schools
* Non-profits and tech unions
* Community centers
* Co-working spaces
* A quiet corner of a pub or restaurant

Be sure to check with the owners of each space to ensure they can accommodate your crowd size, technology offerings (wifi, projector), accessibility needs, catering desires, and any other important personnel considerations.

Also, if you aren't quite ready for an in-person gathering, consider setting up an online meetup!
We are a technology focused community after all.


### Get the word out

You want folks to be able to find your exciting event and learn how they can participate.
To get your event listed on the Ubuntu Community Portal, follow this [Creating an Event Topic](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/creating-an-event-topic/42013) guide.
Once your event is created and listed on the Community Portal, don't forget to share it on social media with all the appropriate **`#ubuntu`** tags.


### Share your successes

After you've hosted or taken part in an event, be sure to let the community hear all about it.
Consider posting a topic on the Ubuntu Discourse, either in the [Events section](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/events/11) or under your Local Community, with a recap of everything you did, learned and experienced.
Don't forget to use the **`#event-report`** tag and add any pictures or videos you may have snapped while you were there!


## Leveling up

### Team verification

Once you've successfully held a few events and have demonstrated a strong degree of organization, you can request verification from the Ubuntu Local Community Council.
Gaining verified status will allow you to request Ubuntu swag, funds for traveling and possible invitations to future Ubuntu events.
Note that the council will look at activity on the Ubuntu Discourse (event reports, general conversations) to determine if your team is eligible, so it's important to be active on that platform.

To request verification for your local community, post a topic with the title "Verification Request - LOCAL COMMUNITY NAME" in the [LoCo Support category](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/loco-support/156) on Discourse.


### UbuCons

Ubuntu Conferences, or UbuCons for short, are organized gatherings of Ubuntu and open source enthusiasts that take place all over the world.
These volunteer run events are typically organized by a Local Community or multiple communities collaborating together.
Any Local Community can host an UbuCon, but only those with significant organization and precision may be eligible for Canonical sponsorship.

You can see previous and upcoming UbuCon events by visiting the [official UbuCon site](https://ubucon.org).


## Other tips and best practices

### Leadership

Ubuntu Local Communities are meant to be collaborative and consensus-led groups.
While many Local Communities opt to elect team leaders, no one person should have complete control over a given region.
As Local Community teams grow and aim to become more organized, they may consider electing additional leaders and specific positions like treasurer, secretary or even social media coordinator.
Every team is different and it's important to do what works best for your community.


### Conflict resolution

Members of Local Communities, like all those who participate in our community, are bound by the {ref}`Ubuntu Code of Conduct <code-of-conduct>`.
This simple set of guiding principles helps ensure our community remains constructive, collaborative, helpful and kind.
If you feel someone is in violation of the Code of Conduct, please contact the [Ubuntu Local Community Council](mailto:loco-council@lists.ubuntu.com) or the [Ubuntu Community Council](mailto:community-council@lists.ubuntu.com).
