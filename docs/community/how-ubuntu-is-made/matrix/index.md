# Matrix


Matrix is an instant messaging (IM) platform where you can talk to Ubuntu community members, on topics ranging from idle chit-chat, over community improvements, to support with your Ubuntu.

In this section you will be able to find core concepts on how Matrix works.
You will learn about the protocol, rooms, spaces, and federation.
You will also read about how Matrix is different from most other synchronous communication platforms.

If you just want to get set up and start chatting, take a look at our {ref}`onboarding instructions <matrix-onboarding>`.
