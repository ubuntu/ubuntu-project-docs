# Room publishing

In Matrix, each server has the concept of a room directory.
It acts as the server's "front page", highlighting essential rooms for newcomers and showcasing the most active and general community discussions.
Consider publishing if your room serves as a gateway for new members into the Ubuntu community or discusses key Ubuntu topics.
The room directory is the entry point for people exploring Ubuntu through the search feature in their Matrix client.

Users joining rooms through the room directory will have no immediate way to explore unpublished rooms, and it remains a flat list.
Therefore, we're also making use of the spaces feature to group rooms and put them in a hierarchy.
This allows potential contributors to explore the Ubuntu ecosystem and join the niche they are most interested in.
We will be linking the Ubuntu Community space in our documentation as an entry point.
