# Create and configure a private space


This short guide walks you through the creation and basic configuration of a private space on the Ubuntu Matrix homeserver.
This guide assumes you are using the Element desktop client.

```{note}
A Matrix Space is technically a type of room.
Reference to rooms in this guide are intentional, to stay aligned with the Element client interface.
```


## Create a private space

1. Click on the {guilabel}`+` icon on the left panel, below your user avatar.

1. Select {guilabel}`Private`.

1. In the {guilabel}`Name` field, type the display name of the space.
   This name can contain upper and lower case characters, spaces, and can be changed later.

1. In the {guilabel}`Description` field, you can add a description of this space.
   This field is optional and can be filled later.

1. Select {guilabel}`Create`.


## Space configuration

### General settings

1. After your space is created, click on the space name drop-down on the left side of your Element desktop client, under the search bar, and select {guilabel}`Settings`.

1. In the {guilabel}`General` settings, you can change "Name", "Description", and upload an image.

1. Once all changes are confirmed, select {guilabel}`Save Changes`.


### Visibility

In the {guilabel}`Visibility` settings, you can:

* Change your space from Public to Private, or space members.

* Enable or disable space preview.
  Keeping this option disabled is recommended for public spaces.
