## Moderation commands

### Redacting user messages

Redacting messages does not kick or ban a particular user, so they could continue their activity.
In certain cases of spam waves, it might be beneficial to kick and ban as well as redacting.


Redact last 100 messages in a specific room
: Command syntax:
  ```none
  !mjolnir redact <user ID> [room alias/ID] [limit] 
  ```

: Example:
  ```
  !mjolnir redact @user:ubuntu.com #room:ubuntu.com 100
  ```

Redact last 100 messages globally
: Command syntax:
  ```none
  !mjolnir redact <user ID> [limit] 
  ```

: Example:
  ```none
  !mjolnir redact @user:ubuntu.com 100
  ```


### Mute a user

Mute or silence a user by setting their "power level" negative:

```none
!mjolnir powerlevel @user:matrix.org -1 #room:ubuntu.com
```


### Kick a user

Kicking removes a user from a room temporarily.
This is not a permanent ban from the room.


Kick using moderation reports
: With moderation reports, you can click on the "kick" button below a report. Mjolnir will take action and kick the user according to the details in the report.


Manually kick user from specific room
: Command syntax:
  ```none
  !mjolnir kick <glob> [room alias/ID] [reason]
  ```

: Example:
  ```none
  !mjolnir kick @user:ubuntu.com #room:ubuntu.com [spam]
  ```


Manually kick a user from all protected rooms
: Command syntax:
  ```none
  !mjolnir kick <glob> [reason]
  ```

: Example:
  ```none
  !mjolnir kick @user:ubuntu.com spam
  ```


### Ban users

A ban removes a user from a homeserver inefinitely.
This is not a permanent ban from the room.
This action is useful in case of repeat offenders or obvious bot spam action.


Ban using moderation reports
: With moderation reports, you can click on the "ban" button below a report. Mjolnir will take action and ban the user according to the details in the report.


Manually ban user for Code of Conduct violations
: Command syntax:
  ```none
  !mjolnir ban <list shortcode> <user|room|server> <glob> [reason]
  ```

: Example:
  ```none
  !mjolnir ban coc user @user:ubuntu.com inappropriate and aggressive behavior
  ```


Manually ban user for spam
: Command syntax:
  ```none
  !mjolnir ban <list shortcode> <user|room|server> <glob> [reason]
  ```

: Example:
  ```none
  !mjolnir ban spam user @user:ubuntu.com spamming inappropriate messages
  ```


### Ban servers

A server ban prevents users from an entire server to join the `ubuntu.com` homeserver.
This is particularly useful to block spam waves, when hundreds of users are created on the same homeserver. 

Command syntax:

```none
!mjolnir ban <list shortcode> <user|room|server> <glob> [reason]
```

As you probably guessed, you are not going to ban a user this time, but a server. For example, to ban the `maliciousdomain.tld` domain:

```none
!mjolnir ban spam server maliciousdomain.tld
```
