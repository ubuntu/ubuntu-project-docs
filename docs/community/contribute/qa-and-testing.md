# Contribute to QA and testing

Ubuntu, like any other software, needs good testers.
You can contribute to Ubuntu simply by running the latest version and reporting software issues -- we call them bugs -- and helping to manage those bugs until they are fixed.
For those feeling more adventurous, the community is always looking for people willing to test out new pre-release versions of Ubuntu.


## Join the QA Team

## Bug reporting

While using Ubuntu, or its many software packages, you may experience a software issue.
There are many reasons why this happens and not all issues constitute a bug.
Issues that are *not* the result of a glitch or a simple user mistake may need a bug report to be filed.
The Ubuntu community uses Launchpad as its primary bug reporting and tracking system.

## Ubuntu pre-release testing

New Ubuntu versions are released every 6 months, which means that prior to their release it is critical to identify and address major bugs.
This is where community testers serve as an invaluable resource.
Helping test Ubuntu and its numerous Flavors is a fun and easy way to give back to the community.
