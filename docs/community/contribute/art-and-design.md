# Contribute to art and design

From its trademark "circle of friends" logo, distinct colour scheme and immediately recognizable font, Ubuntu has long had an iconic look in the open source world.
Members of the community who share a passion for art and design have a number of outlets to demonstrate their abilities.

## Contribute to Vanilla

[Vanilla](https://vanillaframework.io/) is the design system that powers Ubuntu websites and Canonical products. Designers and engineers alike can contribute by proposing new components and patterns, filing bugs, improving documentation or suggesting accessibility and usability enhancements.

Explore the full [design contribution guide](https://vanillaframework.io/docs/contribute/design) for details on the process. You can:

* Start with an [idea](https://vanillaframework.io/docs/contribute/idea) to open a discussion.
* Develop it into a [design proposal](https://vanillaframework.io/docs/contribute/design-proposal) with sketches, annotations, or documentation.

## Community wallpaper competition

The amazing backgrounds in Ubuntu are produced by the community.
Prior to every new release, the community team hosts a wallpaper contest where artists, photographers or anyone feeling artsy can submit their works with the top vote earners getting included in the next release of Ubuntu.

## Flavour art contributions

Ubuntu Flavours often have their own distinctive style and rely on volunteers to help design their art assets.
Getting involved with Flavour art design is a great way to connect with the wider Ubuntu ecosystem and share your artistic skills with the entire community.
