# Matrix Moderators


Moderators ensure everyone in an Ubuntu Matrix room follows the {ref}`Ubuntu Code of Conduct <code-of-conduct>`.
They guide users towards positive behavior and collaborative communication, thereby fostering the Ubuntu community by ensuring Matrix rooms provide a safe and welcoming environment.

Moderators are appointed by the room administrators.
Moderators protect specific Matrix rooms, because each room or space might have slightly different purpose and goals.
Having said that, they must all abide by the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.


## Expectations

* Leading through example
* Fostering long-term successful room environments
* Detaching from situations when feeling pressured to act
* Willingness to seek guidance
* Intervening only when absolutely necessary


### Scope

Moderators operate within the rooms they're entrusted to by the room owners.


### Example cases

* Guiding people on how the room operates
* Helping facilitate room aspirations such as writing documentation, creating polls and performing leadership to achieve the owner's vision
* Fostering the [the spirit of Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/about) through example

## How to find a Moderator

Moderators can be found directly in the Matrix room you are using.
Since privileges aren't always visible over the IRC bridge, each room is required to list their Moderators in the room description.

Failing that, Moderators will often have visible privilege levels by their name.
You can identify Moderators with the "Mod" tag in the "People" panel.

For specific instructions, refer to {ref}`moderators-contact`.
