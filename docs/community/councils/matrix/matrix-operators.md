# Matrix Operators

Operators help the {ref}`matrix-council` with making sure the Ubuntu Matrix platform is running smoothly.
They help define policies, write documentation, and do day-to-day management tasks such as publishing rooms.
Operators typically join Matrix Council meetings, although they have no formal voting power.

You can find the authoritative list of current Operators in the [`matrix-operators`](https://launchpad.net/~matrix-operators/+members) team on Launchpad.

Operators are appointed by the Matrix Council.

Former Matrix Council members have Operator status.
