# Ubuntu Matrix Council

The Matrix Council is highest governance body of the Ubuntu Matrix project.
They define the policies, the moderation guidelines, and appoint operators and defenders.

Even though the Council has the end responsibility in these matters, **we encourage everyone to contribute**.
There is a lot of work ahead of us and they can't do it alone!
Public discussion with the Council and operators happens in the {matrix}`Ubuntu Matrix Ops <matrix-ops>` room.

You can find the authoritative list of current Council members in the [`matrix-council`](https://launchpad.net/~matrix-council/+members) team on Launchpad.

The Council's term is limited until 2026-04-01.
