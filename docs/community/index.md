We are an international community with a mission to bring free software to the widest possible audience. Our name "Ubuntu" means "humanity towards others". We embody this by welcoming anyone in our community and sharing our work freely. With millions of users and thousands of contributors all over the world, we help shape the future of computing.

Welcome! Whether you're an (aspiring) artist, writer, software developer, or systems administrator, there are lots of ways to get involved! We would be thrilled to have a chat and guide you through this beautiful and inspiring community.
