# Matrix ignore list

Matrix has an "Ignore user" feature.
This feature, when used, prevents a Matrix user from reaching you.
Please note that this only affects you, and does not block the particular user for other people in your room or Homeserver. 


## Add a Matrix user to your ignore list

To ignore a user:

* Select the avatar of the user you want to ignore from a chat room

* A side panel opens on the right side of the Element client

* In the {guilabel}`Options` category, select {guilabel}`Ignore`


## Manage your ignore list

To check your ignore list and manage the users on it:

* Select your user avatar on the top left corner of your Element client

* Select the option {guilabel}`Security & Privacy`

* Scroll down to the {guilabel}`Advanced` section

* Check the {guilabel}`Ignored Users` list
