## Ask for Defender help

Matrix users that see offensive, inappropriate, or {ref}`CoC-violating <code-of-conduct>` content, can help the Operations team by reporting it.
Defenders can help with this type of task and they can protect all official Ubuntu rooms.
If you need a Defender:

* Join the Ubuntu {matrix}`Matrix Ops room <matrix-ops>`

* Send a message in this room asking Defender's help and pointing to the room where action needs to be taken, for example: `!defenders please help in room #discuss:ubuntu.com`

Adding `!defenders` before your message triggers a notification to all the Defenders in the Ubuntu homeserver and can be used in any room.

## Ask for moderation help and advice

When a Matrix user witnesses behavior that is not obvious spam, inappropriate, or breaching the CoC, a moderator might be needed.
Moderators observe situations, de-escalate when possible, and intervene when necessary.
If you need the help of a Moderator:

* Click on the name of the room from the top bar of your Element client.
* From the dropdown, select {guilabel}`People` and click on it.
* A panel will open on the right side of your Element client, with a list of users.
* Look for users that have "Mod" next to their name. If you see none, you can reach out to users that have "Admin" next to their name.
* Select the moderator or administrator you want to contact, and click on the user name.
* The panel changes to the particular user; from {guilabel}`Options`, select "Message".


## Contact the Matrix Council

If you need to escalate an issue or reach out to the Matrix Council, refer to {ref}`contact-matrix-council`.
