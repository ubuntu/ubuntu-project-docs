# Getting started with Matrix

This guide will give you more information on how to collaborate with others in the Ubuntu Community using Matrix.
Matrix is a form of real-time Internet chat, where you can talk to many other community members using Ubuntu, on topics ranging from idle chit-chat, over community improvements, to support with your Ubuntu installation.

Though a channel might have many people in it at any one time, they might not always be at their keyboard; so if no-one responds, just wait around and someone will hopefully answer soon enough.


(matrix-get-a-client)=
## Get a client

To connect to Matrix, you first need a "Client" app.
**We strongly recommend using Element** since that is the only client that supports all the features used in our community.
If you already have a Matrix client, you can continue to {ref}`matrix-get-an-account`.

* [Element Web](https://app.element.io/) is the simplest option.
  It works right inside your browser, so you don't need to install anything!

* You can also install Element on every operating system.
  On Ubuntu, you can install the [`element-desktop` snap](https://snapcraft.io/element-desktop).
  For other operating systems, [download Element](https://element.io/download).


(matrix-get-an-account)=
## Get an account

To participate in the conversation, you need to create a Matrix account.
If you already have one, then you can continue to {ref}`matrix-join-the-ubuntu-space`.

* Regular community members who need a new Matrix account can [register at `matrix.org`](https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/matrix-for-im/#creating-a-matrix-account) for free.
  Alternatively, there are many [other providers](https://servers.joinmatrix.org/) you can choose that work in open federation.

* If you're an {ref}`Ubuntu Member <ubuntu-membership>` or work at Canonical, you can register an account {ref}`on the :ubuntu.com homeserver <matrix-register-ubuntu-com>`.


(matrix-join-the-ubuntu-space)=
## Join the Ubuntu space

Once you have an account and a client you can join the Ubuntu Space by typing `/join #community:ubuntu.com`, or by {matrix}`following this link <community>`.
Here you'll get an overview of the most relevant chat rooms in our community.


## Follow the Code of Conduct

When participating in the Ubuntu Community, including our Matrix channels, you agree to abide by the {ref}`Code of Conduct <code-of-conduct>`.

If you have an unpleasant experience where someone else is violating the Code of Conduct, report the message using your client.
In Element Web and Desktop, click on the three dots next to a message and select {guilabel}`Report`.
Community Moderators will receive your report and take appropriate action.


## Next steps

Congratulations, by now you should be ready to chat with the Ubuntu community on Matrix.
