# Matrix bug reporting

Bug reports and feature requests
: Report bugs, issues, and feature requests in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/canonical/synapse-operator/issues). We will review the feedback regularly and use it to resolve issues or consider features to improve interactions between community members and staff.


Matrix discussions
: If you want to take part in the broader discussion about the Ubuntu Matrix project, you can do so in [this Discourse thread](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/modern-communication-platforms-call-for-feedback/36763/), or in the {matrix}`matrix-ops` Matrix Ops room. This is where you can discuss issues or bugs, and where you can discuss the Ubuntu Matrix project in general.


Known issues
: The Element web client is not available on the Ubuntu Matrix instance yet. We will send updates once the Element web client is ready to test. You can use `app.element.io` or a Desktop client as noted in the instructions.
