# Project name

project = "Ubuntu Stable Release Updates"
author = "Canonical Ltd."


# Sidebar documentation title; best kept reasonably short

html_title = project + " documentation"

# Copyright string; shown at the bottom of the page
#
# NOTE: For static works, it is common to provide the first publication year.
#       Another option is to provide both the first year of publication
#       and the current year, especially for docs that frequently change,
#       e.g. 2022–2023 (note the en-dash).
#
#       A way to check a repo's creation date is to get a classic GitHub token
#       with 'repo' permissions; see https://github.com/settings/tokens
#       Next, use 'curl' and 'jq' to extract the date from the API's output:
#
#       curl -H 'Authorization: token <TOKEN>' \
#         -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' \
#         https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/<REPO> | jq '.created_at'
