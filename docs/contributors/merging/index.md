Merging is the process of taking all Ubuntu changes ({term}`Ubuntu delta`) made on top of one Debian version of a package and re-doing them on top of a new Debian version of the package. See {ref}`merges-syncs` for more context information.

## Overview

Merging is done using the {command}`git-ubuntu` tool. As such, the process in many ways follows that of a {command}`git rebase` where commits from one point are replayed on top of another point:

   :zoom:

gitGraph
   commit id: "something 1.2"
   branch 1.2ubuntu
   checkout 1.2ubuntu
   commit id: "Ubuntu changes a, b, c on 1.2"
   commit id: "1.2ubuntu1"
   checkout main
   commit id: "something 1.3"
   branch 1.3ubuntu
   checkout 1.3ubuntu
   commit id: "Ubuntu changes a, b, c on 1.3"
   commit id: "1.3ubuntu1"
```
-->

```none
--- something 1.2 ----------------------------- something 1.3
     \                                           \
      -- Ubuntu changes a, b, c -- 1.2ubuntu1     -- Ubuntu changes a, b, c -- 1.3ubuntu1
```

At a more detailed level, there are other sub-tasks to be done, including:

* Splitting large, "omnibus"-style commits into smaller logical units (one commit per logical unit).
* Harmonizing `debian/changelog` commits into two commits: a changelog merge and a reconstruction.

With this process, we keep the Ubuntu version of a package cleanly applied to the end of the latest Debian version and make it easy to drop changes as they become redundant.
