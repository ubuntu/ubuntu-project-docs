# Advanced contributor tasks

These tasks assume that you are already familiar with the more fundamental
tasks such as bug fixing and patching. In this section, you will find guides
for the more advanced tasks that will support your application for MOTU, Core
Dev, etc.

```


## Proposed migration

Guidance on investigating and resolving issues that block automatic migration from the `-proposed` to the `-release `{term}`pocket`:

```{toctree}

inclusion requests. This improves the long-term maintainability of the packages 
in `main`.

```{toctree}
