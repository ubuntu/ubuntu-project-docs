# Fix a bug in package

```{note}

The following content should be blended together with:
- {ref}`propose-changes`
- {ref}`making-changes-to-a-package`

```

In this tutorial we walk through the process of:

- Evaluating a bug

- Finding a fix for it

- Packaging the fix for Ubuntu

Every bug is unique, of course; this is intended to illustrate the mindset and
steps one should follow generally.


## Required reading

It is strongly recommended that you read the following resources before you
continue, to make sure you are familiar with the concepts:

* [git-ubuntu-clone](https://ubuntu.com/blog/git-ubuntu-clone)
* [DEP-3](http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3)
* {ref}`version-strings`
* [Stable Release Updates (SRUs)](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/)


## Evaluate the Bug

Let's look at an example:
[bug #1753470 report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/postfix/+bug/1753470).


### Bug report description:

The original bug report was filed with just this description:

```none
Fresh install of 18.04 server. Every 5 minutes postconf segfaults:

Mar 5 14:30:05 hostname-here kernel: [ 672.082204] postconf[12975]: segfault at 40 ip 0000564d613ff053 sp 00007ffc39e19b90 error 4 in postconf[564d613e7000+25000]
Mar 5 14:30:06 hostname-here kernel: [ 672.303499] postconf[13004]: segfault at 40 ip 000055b29d0f8053 sp 00007fff72f4b740 error 4 in postconf[55b29d0e0000+25000]
```

According to the Apport log (which is automatically attached to the Launchpad
bug by Apport), the crash is caused by following command line:

```none
$ postconf -h queue_directory
```

Running the command in the shell, however, works as expected and lists the
default spool directory (`/var/spool/postfix`).

```none
ProblemType: Bug
DistroRelease: Ubuntu 18.04
Package: postfix 3.3.0-1
ProcVersionSignature: Ubuntu 4.15.0-10.11-generic 4.15.3
Uname: Linux 4.15.0-10-generic x86_64
ApportVersion: 2.20.8-0ubuntu10
Architecture: amd64
Date: Mon Mar 5 14:26:27 2018
SourcePackage: postfix
UpgradeStatus: No upgrade log present (probably fresh install)
```

Note that the metadata at the end of the description is what gets appended
when the bug report filing is automatically triggered, or if the user uses a
bug reporting assistant (such as Apport).

Sometimes these types of bug reports will also include an attached
"`something.crash`" file. This is created by the Apport process running on the
user's system at the time of segfault, and typically includes the core dump,
logs, and other relevant information. If the user has provided a `.crash`
file, you can examine the
{ref}`Apport Crash manually <debug-apport-crash>`
to get a useful stacktrace.


### Try to reproduce the issue

Not all bugs can be easily reproduced, and it's not always obvious how to
reproduce even reproducible bugs. In these cases, some bug work will be needed
to isolate the problem ourselves, or you'll need to work with bug reporters to
narrow the cause enough to identify a fix.

However, in our example case we're lucky. The bug triagers have identified a
way to reproduce the issue, in
[comment #12](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/postfix/+bug/1753470/comments/12):

```none
ubuntu@bionic-postfix:~$ postconf virtual_alias_map
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
ubuntu@bionic-postfix:~$ dpkg-query -W postfix
postfix 3.3.0-1
ubuntu@bionic-postfix:~$ ll /etc/postfix/valiases.cf
-rw-r----- 1 root root 169 May 7 14:08 /etc/postfix/valiases.cf
ubuntu@bionic-postfix:~$
```

Let's see if we can reproduce the issue as well, using these directions.

Before that, we need to set up an environment for doing the testing. There are
many options for where and how to do your testing, and different developers
have their own preferences. Here's a couple of options:


#### Make a test environment

To make a container for testing:

```none
$ lxc launch ubuntu-daily:bionic tester
```

Alternatively, create a virtual machine (VM) for testing:

```none
$ lxc launch ubuntu-daily:bionic --vm tester
```

With both containers and VMs, you can use the `limits.memory` and `limits.cpu` options to configure available RAM or CPU cores.
For example, to limit the available memory to 2 GiB, and make 2 CPU cores available, add these parameters to the `lxc launch` command:

```none
-c limits.memory=2GiB -c limits.cpu=2
```

Log into the machine:

```none
$ lxc exec tester -- sudo -i -u ubuntu
```

```{note}
The "ubuntu" user's password is locked, but `sudo` can be run without password.
```


#### Get up to date and install `postfix`

```none
ubuntu@tester:~$ sudo apt dist-upgrade
ubuntu@tester:~$ sudo apt install -y postfix
```


#### Tell `postfix` to use a map file

```none
ubuntu@tester:~$ echo "virtual_alias_maps = pgsql:/etc/postfix/valiases.cf" \
 | sudo tee -a /etc/postfix/main.cf
```


#### To reproduce, the file must be unreadable by the current user

```none
ubuntu@tester:~$ sudo touch /etc/postfix/valiases.cf
ubuntu@tester:~$ sudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/valiases.cf
```


#### Reproduce the issue

```none
ubuntu@tester:~$ /usr/sbin/postconf virtual_alias_map
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Now we have confirmed the bug.

```none

Keep track of the commands you used to reproduce the bug. You'll need them
later.
```


## Check if it's already been fixed

Often we can save time by leveraging someone else's work, so it's always
worth doing some research up-front. Fixes for bugs can sometimes be found in
newer versions of Ubuntu, Debian, or upstream, and sometimes in external
forums or bug trackers.


### Was it fixed in a newer Ubuntu?

The easiest way to check is to review the package's status in Ubuntu:

```none
$ rmadison postfix
 postfix | 2.9.1-4           | precise         | source, amd64, armel, armhf, i386, powerpc
 postfix | 2.9.6-1~12.04.3   | precise-updates | source, amd64, armel, armhf, i386, powerpc
 postfix | 2.11.0-1          | trusty          | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el
 postfix | 2.11.0-1ubuntu1.2 | trusty-updates  | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el
 postfix | 3.1.0-3           | xenial          | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el, s390x
 postfix | 3.1.0-3ubuntu0.3  | xenial-updates  | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el, s390x
 postfix | 3.3.0-1           | bionic          | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, ppc64el, s390x
 postfix | 3.3.0-1ubuntu1    | cosmic          | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, ppc64el, s390x
```

Debian can also be worth checking:

```none
$ rmadison -u debian postfix
postfix    | 3.3.0-1          | testing        | source, amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, i386, mips64el, mipsel, ppc64el, s390x
postfix    | 3.3.0-1          | unstable       | source, amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, i386, mips64el, mipsel, ppc64el, s390x
...
```

We see from the first output that `3.3.0-1ubuntu1` exists under Cosmic, so
`postfix` has been modified there. Let's see what was changed.


#### Clone the Package

Find the repository name:

```none
$ apt-cache show postfix | grep Source:
```

In this case, there is no "Source" field, so we just use "`postfix`".

```none
$ git ubuntu clone postfix postfix-gu
```

This will create a new git clone of the postfix repo named `postfix-gu`, with
a remote of `pkg`. The current branch will be `ubuntu-devel`, and the various
versions for each distribution version will be under `pkg/ubuntu/version`.

Notes:

* Due to [this bug](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1761821), you may get:
  `fatal: could not read Username for 'https://git.launchpad.net': terminal prompts disabled.` 
  It's safe to ignore this.
 * The first time you run this command, a git-ubuntu entry will be added to
   `.gitignore`.
 * Sometimes it can be helpful to checkout the git repositories for the
   package maintained by Debian and/or upstream. These would be checked out
   to "`postfix-debian`" and "`postfix`" respectively.

Here we see both the patch and the change to `debian/patches/series` to
include the patch. This is the fix we need!


### Was it fixed in Debian?

Sometimes the fix may have been updated in Debian instead of Ubuntu. There are
many ways to locate fixes from Debian. Debian maintains its own git
repository for many (but not all) of its packages, so having a clone of this
can be handy.

For example, let's assume for argument's sake that we had a problem with
`sshd` in Xenial, where it would fail to check config files before reloading
([as in this bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/+bug/1771340)).
From Debian's `openssh`
[source package page](https://packages.debian.org/source/stretch/openssh),
we find the git repository at `https://salsa.debian.org/ssh-team/openssh` and
can check it out:

```none
$ git clone https://salsa.debian.org/ssh-team/openssh.git openssh-debian
$ cd openssh-debian
$ git branch -av | cat
* master                               296562ba1 releasing package openssh version 1:8.2p1-4

  remotes/origin/wheezy-backports      1d95da812 Remove now-unnecessary backports-specific version changes.
```

That's a lot of branches, but the ones of most interest will be `master` and
sometimes `experimental`. `master` is already checked out, so lets peruse its
commit history. Doing this, we find:

```none
commit d4181e15b03171d1363cd9d7a50b209697a80b01
Author:     Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>
AuthorDate: Mon Jun 26 10:18:26 2017 +0100
Commit:     Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>
CommitDate: Mon Jun 26 10:18:26 2017 +0100

    Test configuration before starting or reloading sshd under systemd (closes: #865770).
```

Our issue would be the same as Debian bug #865770.

It's also possible to search for commits via Debian's web front-end for git,
[Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org). Doing so in this case would bring you to
[this commit](https://salsa.debian.org/ssh-team/openssh/commit/d4181e15b03171d1363cd9d7a50b209697a80b01)

Either way, you should also mention the Salsa link in the fixed-up bug report,
and you should also include it in your fix commit message.

Since we can't push new versions of packages to previous Ubuntu releases,
you'll need to backport the fix by copying what Debian did into a new commit
on Xenial.


### Was it fixed upstream?

For bugs that aren't already fixed in Ubuntu or Debian, sometimes the original
developers of the software have already found and fixed the issue, or at least
are aware of it and may have a proposed solution or workaround available.

From the unpacked package directory, a quick way to see if there's a newer
upstream release is via `uscan`:

```none
$ cd dovecot-gu/
$ uscan --safe
uscan: Newest version of dovecot on remote site is 2.3.10, local version is 2.3.7.2
uscan:    => Newer package available from
  https://dovecot.org/releases/2.3/dovecot-2.3.10.tar.gz
```

This only works if the package has a `debian/watches` file. If it doesn't,
look in the package's README or other documentation, and do the research
online manually.

Searching the upstream bug tracker, or generally Googling error messages or
symptoms can sometimes turn up a patch or bug report of relevance.


### Forwarding issues upstream

If there are no existing fixes for an issue, you can either develop one
yourself, or communicate the problem to Debian or the upstream developers.

Sometimes clues can be found "in the wild" via random forum posts or bug
trackers, but be aware these can span the full range from high quality to
dangerous - so treat them only as ideas and don't accept anything blindly.

Each upstream project has its own conventions and expectations for how they
can be communicated with. Check the source tree and the development section of
the upstream project's website for policies, or study other recent bug reports
and patch contributions for best practices to follow.

In general though, it is a good idea to make sure you are able to reliably
reproduce the issue yourself. Document the steps you took in a way that
non-Ubuntu users could follow. If there is a workload or test case, try to
simplify it down to the minimal set of commands needed to reproduce the issue.

When filing the bug report or pull request upstream, do identify yourself as
an Ubuntu developer, and your role in forwarding an issue reported against
the distribution.


## Apply the fix

Changes to packages are done via patches.
- `debian/patches/` stores the patches themselves, under the root of the
  package repository.
- `debian/patches/series` lists the order in which the patches should be
  applied.
- `debian/changelog` lists the changes made to the package over time.

We use `git-ubuntu` to make changes to packages.


### Step 1: Assign the task to yourself

First, going back to our [example case](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/postfix/+bug/1753470)

Go to the task (row) that starts with "bionic" and assign the task to yourself.

Switch the status to "in progress" using the yellow pencil icons.


### Step 2: Clone the package (if you haven't already)

Find the repository name:

```none
$ apt-cache show postfix | grep Source:
```

In this case, there is no Source field, so we just use `postfix`.

```none
$ git ubuntu clone postfix postfix-gu
$ cd postfix-gu
```


### Step 3: Make a branch based on the appropriate Ubuntu branch

The affected version of `postfix` is in Bionic, so we branch from
`bionic-devel`. It helps to use a descriptive branch name.

```none
$ git checkout pkg/ubuntu/bionic-devel -b postfix-sru-lp1753470-segfault-bionic
```


### Step 4: Make a patch to fix the issue (maybe)

If the only changes you made are within the `debian/` sub-directory, you don't
need a patchfile, and can skip this step.

On the other hand, if you've made changes to the upstream code (anything
outside of the `debian/` directory), you'll need to generate a patch in
`debian/patches`.

For instructions, see {ref}`Making a Patchfile <work-with-debian-patches>`.


### Step 5: Commit the patch

See {ref}`committing your changes <committing-changes>`.


## Build a fixed package

See {ref}`Package Building <package-building>`.


## Test the Package


### Start a Bionic container and enter it:

We can name our LXC containers with any scheme we wish, such as 'tester'
earlier for a temporary one to test with. However, for bug fixes we'll often
need to keep the container around for reference as the bug fix goes through
the review, sponsorship, and SRU processes.

So, to keep things consistent let's reuse our git branch name, and just
prefix the package name:

```none
$ lxc launch ubuntu:bionic postfix-sru-lp1753470-segfault-bionic
Creating postfix-sru-lp1753470-segfault-bionic
Starting postfix-sru-lp1753470-segfault-bionic

$ lxc exec postfix-sru-lp1753470-segfault-bionic -- bash
root@postfix-sru-lp1753470-segfault-bionic:~# 
```


### Reproduce the bug

Record your steps as you go (you'll need them later):

```none
# apt dist-upgrade
# apt install -y postfix
# touch /etc/postfix/valiases.cf
# chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/valiases.cf
# echo "virtual_alias_maps = pgsql:/etc/postfix/valiases.cf" >> /etc/postfix/main.cf
# su - ubuntu
$ /usr/sbin/postconf virtual_alias_map
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```


### Install the fixed package

In this case, I'm using a PPA. Alternatively, if you've built locally, you can
copy in the `.deb` file and install it manually.

```none
$ sudo add-apt-repository -ys ppa:kstenerud/postfix-sru-lp1753470-segfault
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade -y
```


### Test the bug again

```none
$ /usr/sbin/postconf virtual_alias_map
/usr/sbin/postconf: warning: virtual_alias_map: unknown parameter
```

The bug is fixed! Sweet!


## Run the package tests

The DEP-8 autopkgtests don't exercise our bug, but are worth running as
just-in-case checks (and to catch regressions).

See {ref}`Running Package Tests <package-tests>`.

Any change in behavior should be considered as priorities to resolve before
proceeding.


## Start a merge proposal

See {ref}`merge-proposals`.


## Update the bug report

For regular bug fixes and merges, adding a comment about your progress is
typically all you'll need. You might provide some links to your PPA if you'd
like to get people to test your fix, or if you want to provide the fix to the
user-base swiftly.


### SRU paperwork

For stable release updates (SRUs), on the other hand, you need to add a bit
more detail.

Go back to the
[example bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/postfix/+bug/1753470).

Modify the bug description (yellow pencil icon) and update it to conform with
[the SRU bug template](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/reference/bug-template/).
These are normally the "Impact", "Test Case" and "Where problems could occur"
sections.

It is good practice to make the "Test Case" section itemized with explicit
steps, "paint-by-numbers" style. It is also best practice to include both a
"Development Fix" and "Stable Fix"; the former explains the situation with the
fix in the current development release, while the latter explains your
strategy for addressing (or skipping) it in LTS and other stable releases.

```{note}

Keep the original description as-is, in a section called
"Original Description" at the bottom.
```

```{note}
You'll see your branch and merge proposal in the `Related branches` because of
the (`LP: #NNNNNN`) in the changelog entry.
```


### SRU exceptions

There is a particular kind of
[special case SRU](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/reference/package-specific/)
which is called either a Minor Release Exception (MRE) or an SRU exception. In
the former we assume upstream is so stable and similar to our needs, process
and philosophy that fewer checks need to be done, in the latter we admit that
there is more to check - but both do more than the isolated individual bug
fixing that a normal SRU would do.

The work to get these exceptions granted gives us confidence that the minor
releases created by upstream take sufficient care over testing, ABI & API
stability, smooth upgradability, and other things important for an SRU.

Each case is slightly different, which is why each of them gets their own
discussion and their own accepted process listed in
[SRU special cases](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/reference/package-specific/)
of how that particular minor release will be served.

When we (in the server team) prepare special SRU updates they follow all the
normal SRU rules as outlined here, but in addition will follow all steps and
requirements outlined in the particular SRU exception. That usually includes
additional checks and validations.

There is one more thing that we (the server team) can do in addition for any
SRU exception upload that we work on. That is, to double check upstream
release notes and changelogs to ensure that there was really nothing that
would unexpectedly break the "stable" in SRU.

That is worthwhile for MREs where we expect nothing should<sup>(TM)</sup>
happen and even more so for general SRU exceptions. 

After having passed an SRU exception process, there is always a small chance
that the upstream project might have a slightly different stance/decision
policy with regard to stable releases. This check by our team will help to
serve those updates in the stable and reliable fashion our users expect them
to be.

To be clear, the expectation is that we should not find anything in this
check, but this is a classic case of "better safe than sorry".


## SRU review process

There is a distinction between sponsorship and the SRU process. They are
possibly a little confused in the SRU wiki page (especially section 6 “Fixing
several bugs in one upload").

Consider the process from the point of view of your sponsor and the SRU team.
On review, they will start from the diff and expect to see:

* **The diff fully explained by the changelog entry**.
  This means that if there is something in the diff that isn't explained by
  the changelog, then there is a problem.
* **A bug for everything mentioned in the changelog entry**.
  Reviewers are pragmatic: there is no strict rule that "every bullet point
  must refer to a bug", but rather that logically everything mentioned should
  correspond to a bug so the reviewer can go to a bug to find more info on
  any part of the changelog.
  
  For an SRU, even added functionality must refer to a bug. If some part of a
  changelog entry does not obviously refer to a bug, then there is a problem.
* **Every issue mentioned in an SRU changelog must have a bug task filed
  against the package**. The same bug # can be mentioned in different SRUs,
  since a bug may have multiple bug tasks. The Ubuntu Bug Control Team, or
  other members of the server team can assist if you need help creating bug
  tasks.
* **The issue should be resolved for the Ubuntu development release**. This is
  tracked by having a bug task set to "Fix Released" for the devel series.
  The goal is to avoid regression from a user’s perspective when they upgrade
  to the newer Ubuntu release. If the status is not "Fix Released" but you
  still want to proceed with the SRU, explain what is going on in a
  "Development Fix" section.
* **Every LP bug # mentioned in an SRU changelog must have "SRU paperwork"
  filled out**. As described in the previous section.

After you or your sponsor have uploaded your package:
* Set the bug task status to "In Progress".
* The upload will appear in the "unapproved queue", for example 
  `https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/+queue?queue_state=1`. It may take a
  week or two before it gets processed.
* If you find a problem while it's still unapproved, ask in the Libera Chat
  `#ubuntu-release` channel for the package to be rejected from the queue.
  This is a trivial task for archive admins. If rejected at this stage, then
  the same version number can be re-used in a subsequent upload.
* The SRU team will review incoming SRU uploads from the unapproved queue and
  expect to see the review items completed correctly as above. They will
  either accept or reject (with a reason) from the unapproved queue. If they
  reject, then you will need to handle the rejection reason and then start
  again from the beginning. If they accept, then the bug task will change to
  "Fix Committed", the package will enter the `-proposed` pocket and then the
  package binaries will be built.


## When the bugfix is accepted


### The acceptance email

You'll receive an email notification that the bugfix was accepted:

```none
Accepted postfix into bionic-proposed. The package will build now and be
available at
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/postfix/3.3.0-1ubuntu0.1 in a few
hours, and then in the -proposed repository.

Please help us by testing this new package.  See
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation on how
to enable and use -proposed.Your feedback will aid us getting this
update out to other Ubuntu users.

If this package fixes the bug for you, please add a comment to this bug,
mentioning the version of the package you tested and change the tag from
verification-needed-bionic to verification-done-bionic. If it does not
fix the bug for you, please add a comment stating that, and change the
tag to verification-failed-bionic. In either case, details of your
testing will help us make a better decision.

Further information regarding the verification process can be found at
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/PerformingSRUVerification .  Thank you in
advance!

** Changed in: postfix (Ubuntu Bionic)
       Status: In Progress => Fix Committed

** Tags added: verification-needed verification-needed-bionic
```

Follow the
[build link](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/postfix/3.3.0-1ubuntu0.1)
and make sure it's publishing to the correct place (Bionic), and that the
builds completed (green check marks).


### The excuses page

Check the "excuses" or "migration" page,
[for Bionic](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/bionic/update_excuses.html)
in this case.

[General page](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html)

Eventually, the package with your fixes will appear there (search for
`postfix` in this case). It will show the DEP-8 tests for `postfix` and
anything that depends on it. Any tests that fail will show in red.

### SRU verification

It's best to have the package independently verified (preferably by the person
who reported the bug), but if it sits idle too long (2 days or so), you can
verify it yourself. Follow the
[instructions provided](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/howto/common-issues/)
by the SRU team, which usually means changing the "verification-needed" tag
into "verification-done".

[Pending SRU](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/pending-sru.html) shows which SRUs
are pending and what their status is. Note that this includes DEP-8 test
results; if these have failed then it's unlikely the SRU team will release
the update, so it's wise to follow-up if this happens.

Once all of the SRU's bugs have reached `verification-done` and a 7-day
waiting period has elapsed, the SRU team will move the source and binary
packages into the `-updates` pocket and mark the bug task(s) as "Fix Released".
