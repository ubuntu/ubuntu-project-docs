# Ubuntu Bug Control

When a public bug is reported in Launchpad for a specific Ubuntu package, it starts with initial values for
its control data (Status, Importance, Assigned-To, ...). These control fields can be changed to reflect the
lifecycle of the bug by Launchpad users with appropriate privilege. A logged-in Launchpad user can modify
a certain number of these control fields; the other fields can only be edited if you are part of the
Ubuntu Bug Control team.

The Ubuntu Bug Control team ([`ubuntu-bugcontrol`](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-bugcontrol) in Launchpad)
is a subset of the Ubuntu Bug Squad who can change the importance of Ubuntu bug tasks, set the status
of an Ubuntu bug task to "Triaged" or "Won't Fix" and target a bug for a release of Ubuntu.

Both individuals and teams can join Ubuntu Bug Control. There are generic requirements and specific requirements
for a team or individual to join the team.

More details on the requirements and application process can be found at the [Ubuntu Bug Control Wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugControl).
