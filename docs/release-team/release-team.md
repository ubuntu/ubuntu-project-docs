# The Release Team

The [Ubuntu Release Team](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-release) is responsible
for the overall {ref}`release-cycle`, which includes monitoring the healthy
development and stability of the Ubuntu distribution.

During the {term}`devel` development phase, they handle milestones such as
Freezes and Beta to ensure that the Final Release will be in a good state. For
{ref}`lts-releases`, the Release Team is also responsible for producing
{ref}`point-releases` approximately every 6 months (until the next LTS).

A subset of the Release Team is the
[Canonical Release Management](https://launchpad.net/~canonical-ubuntu-qa) team.
This group oversees the Canonical infrastructure that facilitates the Release
Team's work.
