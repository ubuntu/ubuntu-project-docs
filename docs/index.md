Ubuntu is the world's most widely deployed Linux operating system.
It's also a long-standing software project, with a mesh of distributed processes and governance that enable our global community of contributors to deliver the distribution we all know and love.

Ubuntu has always been an openly governed community.
This open governance means that we have community-organized and run decision-making groups that lead and make decisions about different elements of Ubuntu.

There are many ways to contribute to Ubuntu -- from packaging core pieces of the operating system, writing applications for the Desktop, providing translations, working on documentation, designing wallpapers, QA, and more.

This documentation contains all the information you need about how Ubuntu is made, the people who make Ubuntu, and how to contribute to the project.
