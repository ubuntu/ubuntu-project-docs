Ubuntu is the world's most widely deployed Linux operating system, but it's also
a long-standing software project, a community, and a mesh of distributed
processes and governance that enable its contributors to deliver the world-class
experience we've come to know and love.

Ubuntu has always been a very openly governed community. This open governance
means that we have some community organized and run decision-making groups that
help us to lead and make decisions about different elements of Ubuntu.

There are many ways to contribute to Ubuntu - be that packaging of core pieces
of the operating system, writing applications for the Desktop, providing
translations, working on documentation, designing wallpapers, QA, and more.
This documentation will outline those contributor journeys, and the processes
that govern them.
