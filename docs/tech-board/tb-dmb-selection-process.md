# DMB selection process

:::{note}
This document and the rules it sets forth are owned by the Ubuntu {ref}`technical-board`.
:::

The {ref}`dmb` is responsible for reviewing and
approving new Ubuntu developers.

The Developer Membership Board comprises seven seats. Seats are
appointed by the Technical Board asynchronously as required.

When the DMB needs members, the TB will ask for suitably qualified
volunteers to apply privately.

Volunteers must be Ubuntu {ref}`dmb-joining-core-dev` or {ref}`dmb-joining-motu`[^1], and should be well
qualified to evaluate prospective Ubuntu developers and decide when to
entrust them with developer privileges or to grant them Ubuntu
membership status.

Volunteers must expect to be able to attend the majority of DMB
meetings. Currently these take place on IRC, are scheduled on alternate
Mondays with each meeting alternating between 1600 UTC and 1900 UTC, and
last around an hour. Meeting times can be negotiated and adjusted by
board members as needed.

The TB reserves their option to exclude particular volunteers
(privately), but this should only happen under exceptional
circumstances.

The TB announces new appointments which can therefore happen at any
time.

We'd like DMB members to commit to a one year minimum, but DMB members
can resign at any time.

When a member's term is nearing its end, Launchpad will ask them if they
wish to renew, and they can renew their term directly on Launchpad by
themselves. By doing so, they are affirming that they expect to
participate for a further year.

If a member wishes to stand down, they can leave the Launchpad team or
wait for their Launchpad team membership to lapse.

As long as there are routinely fewer volunteers than seats, this process
will continue. Should the situation change, the TB will adjust the
process accordingly, which may include moving to the election-based
appointment model we had used previously.
