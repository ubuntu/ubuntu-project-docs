Launchpad
=========

Launchpad is a software collaboration and hosting platform similar to platforms like `GitHub`_. Launchpad is also the platform where the :term:`Ubuntu` project lives. This is one of the major differences between the Ubuntu and :term:`Debian` infrastructure.

.. note::

    Although the Ubuntu project is probably the largest user base of Launchpad, Launchpad can be used by anyone.

Launchpad features, among others, are:

- **Bugs**: :term:`Bug Tracking System`
- **Code**: :term:`source code` hosting with :term:`Git` or :term:`Bazaar`, :term:`version control <Version Control System>` and :term:`code review` features
- **Answers**: community support site and knowledge base
- **Translations**: collaboration platform for localizing software
- **Blueprints**: feature planning and specification tracking
- Ubuntu :term:`package` building and hosting
- Team/Group management

While platforms like GitHub put users and groups at the top level, Launchpad puts projects at the top level. If you take Ubuntu as an example, you can see that you can access it at the top level: `https://launchpad.net/ubuntu`. Users and groups begin with a ``~``, for instance `https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-foundations-team`.


Why not use platforms like GitHub?
----------------------------------

Although Launchpad's :term:`UI` and :term:`UX` are a bit dated, Launchpad offers an unparalleled Ubuntu package building and hosting infrastructure that no other platform offers. Even simple requirements like building for architectures like :term:`PowerPC`, :term:`s390x`, or :term:`RISC-V` cannot be fulfilled by GitHub or similar platforms.


Personal Package Archive (PPA)
------------------------------

Launchpad PPA repositories allow you to build installable Ubuntu packages for multiple :term:`architectures <Architecture>` and to host them in your own software :term:`repository <Repository>`.

Using a PPA is straightforward; you don't need the approval of anyone, therefore users have to enable it manually. See how to `Install packages from a PPA <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/user/how-to/packaging/ppa-install/>`_.

This is useful when you want to test a change, or to show others that a change builds successfully or is installable. Some people have special permission to trigger the :term:`autopkgtests <autopkgtest>` for packages in a PPA.

.. tip::

    You can ask in the :term:`IRC` channel ``#ubuntu-devel`` if someone can trigger 
    autopkgtests in your PPA if you don't have the permission.


Git-based workflow for the development of Ubuntu source packages
----------------------------------------------------------------

Launchpad hosts a :term:`git-ubuntu` importer service, which maintains a view of the entire packaging version history of Ubuntu :term:`source packages <Source Package>` using Git repositories with a common branching and tagging scheme. The :command:`git-ubuntu` :term:`CLI` provides tooling and automation that understands these repositories to make the development of Ubuntu itself easier.

To see the web-view of these repositories, click the :guilabel:`Code` tab of any source package on Launchpad.


Text markup
-----------

Launchpad has some markup features that you can use when you e.g. report bugs, write comments, create merge proposals.

See the `TODO: add link to new LP docs` reference for more details.


Getting help
------------

For help with Launchpad, choose any of the following methods:


IRC chat rooms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the ``irc.libera.chat`` :term:`IRC` server, find the ``#launchpad`` channel, where you can ask the Launchpad team and the Ubuntu community for help.


Mailing lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ask for help via email, write to the `launchpad-users <https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-users>`_ mailing list (``launchpad-users@lists.launchpad.net``).


Ask a question
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned above, Launchpad has a `community FAQ feature <https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad>`_ (called "Answers") where you can see other people's questions or ask one yourself. Use the *Answers* feature of the Launchpad project on Launchpad itself.


Report a bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To submit a bug related to Launchpad, use the :term:`Bug Tracking System` of the Launchpad project `on Launchpad itself <https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad>`_.


Staging environment
-------------------

Before new features are deployed to the production environment, they are `deployed to a staging environment <https://qastaging.launchpad.net/>`_ where the changes can get tested.

Use the staging environment, to try out Launchpad features.


API
---

Launchpad has a web :term:`API` to interact with its services. This allows developer communities to automate specific workflows.

The reference `documentation for the web API <https://launchpad.net/+apidoc/>`_ on Launchpad.

The Launchpad team created an :term:`open source <Open Source Software>` Python library, `launchpadlib <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/user/explanation/launchpad-api/launchpadlib/>`_.
