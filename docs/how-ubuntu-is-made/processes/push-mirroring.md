As explained on [Debian's documentation](http://www.debian.org/mirror/push_mirroring)
on this subject:

> Push mirroring is a form of mirroring that minimizes the time it takes 
> for changes to the main archive to reach mirrors. The server mirror uses
> a triggering mechanism to immediately inform the client mirror that it
> needs to be updated.
>
> Push mirroring takes a little more effort to set up since the maintainers
> of the upstream and downstream mirror must exchange information. The 
> benefit is that the upstream mirror initiates the mirror process immediately
> after its archive has been updated. This allows changes to the archive to
> propagate extremely quickly. 

So instead of relying on cron jobs to keep things in sync, mirrors can be asked
to sync when it is necessary. SSH is usually used, however we can offer HTTP
triggers if preferred.

## Setup

Your mirror should have previously been set up to use cron jobs and mirroring
scripts. Such scripts {ref}`can be found here <mirror-scripts>`.

We recommend that you create an `ubuntu` user and grant it permissions to the
directory where your mirror is stored. Then place the keys below (or from
whichever mirror you are syncing from) into that user's `authorized_keys` file.

When the upstream mirror connects as the `ubuntu` user to your mirror, it will
run the script and background the process. Meanwhile the `rsync` command called
by the script, will connect to the upstream mirror and sync any changes as needed.

When this setup has been completed, please {ref}`let us know here <mirrors-communication>`
and we'll set up the necessary trigger commands on our end.

If the command is not run in the background, you can try redirecting `stdin`,
`stdout` and `stderr` to `/dev/null` using the following command :

```
command="~/archive-sync </dev/null >/dev/null 2>/dev/null &"
```

## Keys

These are the SSH keys used for triggering archive and releases mirrors
respectively. Please be sure to change the `command=` option to the location of
your mirroring script and do **not** remove the backgrounding character (`&`)
after it.

The keys below are for mirrors pushed by **Canonical-only**, these mirrors
should be syncing from **`rsync.archive.ubuntu.com`** (for packages) and
**`rsync.releases.ubuntu.com`** (for CD release images). Connections from
Canonical will be originating from the IP address: `91.189.88.154` and
`185.125.188.80` for archive, and `91.189.88.156` and `185.125.188.81` for
releases - so please ensure that your firewalls allow this.

For authenticity; these keys are signed by
[`Haw Loeung`](https://launchpad.net/~hloeung) with the key ID `0xD10ACEB3227B53FC`.

If you are not being pushed by Canonical, please contact the mirror
administrator of the mirror you're being pushed from for their keys and be sure
to have your sync source set to their mirror.

### HTTP triggers

While SSH triggers (above) are the preferred trigger method, it is also possible
for the master Ubuntu archive to send HTTP triggers.
HTTP triggers can be nearly any format, for example:

```
http://ubuntu-archive:8BBsmDsLXpjJvSjM4nZv@cctld.mirrors.example.com/trigger
http://ubuntu-releases:zT99CGf9V499RH9SQFtV@cctld.mirrors.example.com/trigger
```

or:

```
http://cctld.mirrors.example.com/ubuntu-archive/53cfa724-f75d-44a1-b9d2-a14e637887bc/trigger
http://cctld.mirrors.example.com/ubuntu-releases/f4b95974-9862-40ba-a476-f751c30c5f31/trigger
```

The first example uses usernames and (long random) passwords to a trigger
destination, and would decide which component to begin syncing based on the
authenticated username. The second example places the component name and (long
random) UUID in the path itself. Treat these URLs as sensitive, to avoid outside
users triggering unnecessary syncs.

It is up to the mirror administrator to build logic into the HTTP endpoint which
authenticates the master Ubuntu archive and begins a sync. This logic varies
wildly based on your specific platform. Output format is undefined; the master
simply loads the URL and moves on without examining the output.
