# Ubuntu on Github

In addition to code/projects on Launchpad and the Ubuntu archive, Ubuntu also maintains projects under [github.com/ubuntu](https://github.com/ubuntu).

## Access

Repositories under github.com/ubuntu are individually managed by their owners as admin.

Ubuntu members that get {ref}`Ubuntu Core Developer <dmb-joining-core-dev>` permission are also added as [members of the organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization) with access to the whole scope of [github.com/ubuntu](https://github.com/ubuntu). Repository owners cannot revoke this access.

This is inclusive (Ubuntu Core Developers get access to the whole scope) and not exclusive (one does not need to be an Ubuntu Core Developer to be allowed access to an individual project).

## Contributions

Projects under [github.com/ubuntu](https://github.com/ubuntu) do not generally require the signing of the [Canonical contributor licence agreement](https://canonical.com/legal/contributors).
