# Guides for maintainers

In general, this should probably be split *by task* and then ordered by either
increasing permissions required (i.e. from lowest to highest), or by
frequency (i.e. most common tasks first)

These guides are for those with elevated permissions on particular tasks who
are responsible for maintaining the Package Archive or managing processes.
