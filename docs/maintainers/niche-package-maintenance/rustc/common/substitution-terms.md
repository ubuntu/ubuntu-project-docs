## Substitution Terms

From now on, the documentation will contain certain terms within angle brackets which must be replaced with the actual value that applies to your situation.

As an example, let's assume you are updating `rustc-1.84` (upstream version `1.84.0`) to `rustc-1.85` (upstream version `1.85.1`) for Noble Numbat:

- `<X.Y>`: The short Rust version you're updating _to_.
  - Example: `1.85`
- `<X.Y.Z>`: The long Rust version you're updating _to_.
  - Example: `1.85.1`
- `<X.Y_old>`: The short Rust version you're updating _from_.
  - Example: `1.84`
- `<X.Y.Z_old>`: The long Rust version you're updating _from_.
  - Example: `1.84.0`
- `<release>`: The target {term}`Ubuntu release` adjective.
