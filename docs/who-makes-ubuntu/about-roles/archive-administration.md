# Archive Administration

Every contributor to Ubuntu is concerned with the good health and long-term
maintainability of the Package Archive. Although many operations can be handled
by uploaders, there are certain specific activities in the Archive that
require an additional level of administrative privileges above Core Dev. These
specific activities are handled by the **Archive Administration (AA)** team.

The [Ubuntu Package Archive Administrators team](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-archive)
is often referred to as "the Archive Admins" or just "the AA team".

The full list of tasks the Archive Admin team is responsible for can be found
in {ref}`aa-tasks`.

## How to contact the team

The Archive Admin team does not have a published shift rotation system as some
other teams do. They perform the tasks they are responsible for on a regular
basis to keep the machinery working in good order.

When you submit a bug that requires the attention of an Archive Admin, they will
find it when processing {ref}`aa-tasks`. This means that
you generally just need to follow the outlined processes (using bugs).

For special cases, you can contact an Archive Admin of your choice using the
[`ubuntu-development`](https://matrix.to/#/#devel:ubuntu.com) or
[`ubuntu-release`](https://matrix.to/#/#release:ubuntu.com) channels on Matrix.

However, to speak directly to the AA team, you can use the
[`ubuntu-development` Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#devel:ubuntu.com).
