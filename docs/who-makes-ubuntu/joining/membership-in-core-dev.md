# Membership in Core Developers

[Core developers](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers#CoreDev) are members
of the `ubuntu-core-dev` team in Launchpad. Core Devs maintain all packages in
Ubuntu, which notably includes uploading to the `main` component. Core Dev
members also have elevated privileges for re-triggering autopkgtests and
performing other administrative actions in Ubuntu.

## Application process

1. Plan ahead of time to start attending the
   [Developer Membership Board (DMB) meetings](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/Agenda)
   as you prepare your application. If there is a queue of applications, you'll
   want to reserve a spot early since the meetings are held every 2 weeks and
   only 2 applications are processed per meeting.

1. [Prepare an application form](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/ApplicationProcess)
    in the wiki.

1. Collect **endorsements**.

## Training and preparation

Most people applying for Core Dev membership will have a history of involvement
in Ubuntu, working their way up from {ref}`Package Set <membership-in-packageset>`
and/or {ref}`MOTU <membership-in-MOTU>` membership. If you're skipping over those
levels it is nevertheless worth reviewing their training and application
processes to make sure you'll be fulfilling their requirements.

In addition to understanding common tasks documented in this guide, including
{ref}`Debian patching <how-to-work-with-debian-patches>`,
{ref}`Stable Release Updates (SRUs) <how-to-fix-a-bug-in-a-package>`,
and so on, Core Dev applicants must also have a good understanding of these
advanced packaging skills, and ideally direct experience with a few of them:

* [Package sponsorship](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Sponsorship/SponsorsQueue)
* {ref}`Seed handling <seed-management>`
* {ref}`Main inclusion <main-inclusion-review>` for packages
* [New package](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages) integration
* {ref}`Transition <transitions>` of packages with new ABI/API requirements
* [SRU special case exceptions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/reference/package-specific/)

As with applications for {ref}`MOTU <membership-in-MOTU>`, trustworthiness is
crucial for Core Dev. Being able to work with others, and especially
*mentoring* others is extremely important. Look for opportunities to exercise
and demonstrate these attributes, and discuss them in your application.


## Further information

While Core Dev is the highest level for packaging development, there are
several specialized administrative teams that help keep the archive healthy:

* [Developer Membership Board](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard)
* [Technical Board](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard)
* {ref}`Archive Administration <archive-administration>`
* [SRU Administration](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers#SRUDevelopers)
* [Security](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam)
