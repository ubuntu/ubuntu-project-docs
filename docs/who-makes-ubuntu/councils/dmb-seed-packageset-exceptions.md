# DMB seed packagesets exceptions

As outlined for {ref}`seeds based packagesets <dmb-types-of-packagesets>`
there can be cases that cause such a package set to not be absolutely
equivalent to the seed.

Historically those exceptions have been tracked in
[this code](https://code.launchpad.net/~developer-membership-board/+git/packageset),
but when generating them was stopped it became a case by case decision
and was hard to track.

This page provides the compromise (over fully maintaining it in code) of at
least allowing us to track those exceptions along the rules that define
the process.
