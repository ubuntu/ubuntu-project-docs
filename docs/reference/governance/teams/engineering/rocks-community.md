# Rocks Community

The Rocks Community is your hub for exploring Ubuntu Rocks and everything “containers”. Whether you’re a seasoned Rockcraft user or Chisel enthusiast, this community is an inclusive space for learning, sharing, and connecting with fellow Ubuntu container developers.

## Communication

### Matrix

Join our community space at [#rocks:ubuntu.com](https://matrix.to/#/#rocks:ubuntu.com). Newcomers are encouraged to introduce themselves in the general chatroom ([#rocks-general:ubuntu.com](https://matrix.to/#/#rocks-general:ubuntu.com)) and browse the community space for other useful rooms.

### Discourse

Important events and announcements are posted, in their long format, at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/project/rocks/. These may also be cross-referenced in Matrix.

## Meetings

The Rocks Community has a [public calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=cf1e94218f2a806bac23a480c60d2247c4baf73afe0aa57bba85df3b6bce2f56%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FZurich) ([ics](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/cf1e94218f2a806bac23a480c60d2247c4baf73afe0aa57bba85df3b6bce2f56%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)) you can subscribe to, in order to be up to date with all community meetings and events!

### Fortnightly office hours

Called the “Starcraft Clinics”, this meeting happens every week, at alternating times:

- [Starcraft Clinics ({spellexception}`1st` Option)](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/starcraft-clinics-1st-option/43649), and
- [Starcraft Clinics ({spellexception}`2nd` Option)](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/starcraft-clinics-2nd-option/48031)

Here, you can join forces with the developers and users of Rockcraft and other craft tools (like Snapcraft and Charmcraft). Everyone is welcome to come over and discuss issues with the crafts. This is an opportunity to get some face-to-face time with the experts and work together through those issues.

### Monthly meetings

These are general-purpose meetings that take place once a month. Everyone is welcome to join and share their work, discuss containers and propose features.
