Any reasonably large project eventually needs someone at the helm to help steer the projectâ€™s general direction, make official decisions, and decide the right path to take in difficult situations. Ubuntu is no different, except for that it is so big that there are many, many different sub projects within it, each one governed by its own set of leaders.

Below is a list of key teams that operate within the Ubuntu project and their responsibilities:

## Engineering Teams
