Snapd Glib Updates
==================

This document describes the policy for updating the `snapd-glib
package <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapd-glib>`__ in stable
Ubuntu releases.

`snapd-glib <https://github.com/snapcore/snapd-glib/>`__ is a library to
help client applications to communicate with snapd. It provides
appropriate bindings for applications that use GLib, Qt or GObject
bindings. As the snapd project is continuously updated, snapd-glib is
also continuously updated to enable new features. snapd-glib is designed
to be both API and ABI compatible with older releases so these updates
can be rolled out.
