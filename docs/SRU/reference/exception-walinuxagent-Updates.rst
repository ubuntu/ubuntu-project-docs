walinuxagent Updates
====================

This document describes the process to update and test new versions of
the walinuxagent package in SRUs.

The walinuxagent package is an Ubuntu distribution of the upstream
Microsoft Azure Linux Agent that manages Linux provisioning, and VM
interaction with the Azure Fabric Controller. For a detailed list of
functionality this package provides to Ubuntu cloud images, refer to the
upstream project page at GitHub: https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent

Cloud platforms evolve at a rate that can't be handled in six-month
increments, and they will often develop features that they would like to
be available to customers who don't want to upgrade from earlier Ubuntu
releases. As such, updating walinuxagent to more recent upstream
releases is required within all Ubuntu releases, so they continue to
function properly in their environment.

New versions of walinuxagent can be SRUed into older releases provided
the following process is followed.


walinuxagent QA Process
-----------------------

When a new version of walinuxagent is uploaded to -proposed, the
following will be done:

-  the CPC team will write new automated tests to cover new testable
   functionality (if any) in the new package
-  the automated testing that the CPC team normally runs against Azure
   images before they are published will be run against the -proposed
   package
-  the Microsoft Azure Linux Agent team will be asked to validate

   -  that the new package addresses the issues it is expected to
      address, and
   -  that the new package passes their internal image validation, with
      emphasis on walinuxagent extension support.

In addition, the CPC team does the following testing

-  The new package candidate version is built in devel-proposed and
   tested on the target suite. This will involve one or both of:

   -  Installing the devel-proposed packages on an Azure VM, manually
      restoring the VM to a first boot state and rebooting it,
   -  Generating a fresh image with the devel-proposed package version
      preinstalled and testing that directly

-  Once the manual packaging tests pass successfully and the package
   requires no further changes, it will be marked as such on the
   tracking bug. On the development release, this is done by removing
   the **block-proposed** tag.

**If appropriate due to the nature of the changes (embargo on
publication), the steps above may be done in a private PPA prior to
landing in devel-proposed.**

The following additional steps also apply for the SRUs to supported
releases once the packages have been accepted into the development
release (if applicable):

-  Once accepted in to -proposed, a test image is built from -proposed,
   which is subjected to the full CPC image tests; this tests for more
   regressions across multiple Azure instance sizes. This includes tests
   for the following bugs:

   -  `Bug #1479610 regression on dhcp
      configuration <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/walinuxagent/+bug/1479610>`__
   -  `Bug #1079897 mangled server identity and access on
      upgrade <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/walinuxagent/+bug/1079897>`__
   -  `Bug #1305418 breaks sshd
      configuration <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/walinuxagent/+bug/1305418>`__

.. _pre_sru_test_cases:

Pre-SRU Test Cases
------------------

These are the test cases that all walinuxagent are subjected to before
even getting to SRU:

::

   1.) Launch instance on Azure
   2.) Upgrade walinuxagent (usually from PPA)
   3.) Confirm that "waagent" is running, check /var/log/waagent.log for errors
   4.) Reboot, repeat step 3

.. _sru_test_cases:

SRU Test Cases
--------------

These are automated tests:

::

   1.) Build new cloud image with -proposed package
   2.) Boot instance
   3.) Confirm that instance provisioned
   4.) Run standard tests and regression tests
   5.) Repeat from step 2 for all other Azure VM Sizes.

.. _walinuxagent_releasing_the_sru:

Releasing the SRU
-----------------

Since the only consumer of the walinuxagent is the Azure cloud, the SRU
may be released without meeting the aging period of 7 days provided all
the above steps have been completed.


walinuxagent SRU Template
-------------------------

   == Begin SRU Template ==
   [Impact]
   This release contains both bug-fixes and new features and we would like to
   make sure all of our supported customers have access to these improvements.
   The notable ones are:

   *** <TODO: list any LP: # included>

   See the changelog entry below for a full list of changes and bugs.

   [Test Case]
   The following development and SRU process was followed:
   https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/reference/exception-walinuxagent-Updates

   The Microsoft Azure Linux Agent team will execute their testsuite, which
   includes extension testing , against the walinuxagent that is in
   -proposed.  A successful run will be required before the proposed walinuxagent
   can be let into -updates.

   The CPC team will be in charge of attaching a summary of testing to the bug.  CPC team members will not
   mark ‘verification-done’ until this has happened.
