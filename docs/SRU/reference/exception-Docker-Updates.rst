Container Stack Updates
=======================

This document describes the policy for updating the docker.io group of
packages (docker.io-app, containerd-app, runc-app, docker-buildx,
docker-compose-v2) in a stable supported distro, in particular LTS
releases.

Basically docker is a sufficiently fast-moving project that we provide
more value to our users by delivering an "upstream" experience rather
than worrying over-much about backward compatibility or regressions.

Process
-------

The aim is to backport stable and compatible releases across all the
packages that are part of this stack
(runc-app/containerd-app/docker.io-app/docker-buildx/docker-compose-v2)
to all supported releases. **When changes are too disruptive, we may
decide to upgrade one or more of the packages to a new minor or patch
release up to maintainers discretion. When doing so, the upgrades should
still follow the process described here.**

To do this we will:

1. File (or find, our users are quite proactive about wanting this) a bug to cover the upgrade.

2. Upload the latest upstream version of the packages to the current development series of Ubuntu. Make sure all the versions are compatible among them.

3. Updating stable releases:

 a. Once they have migrated, they can then be uploaded with minimal necessary changes to the SRU queue of the supported Ubuntu releases. For docker.io-app, docker-buildx and docker-compose-v2, .0 releases will not be backported; for containerd-app and runc-app, .0 releases are eligible for backporting.

 b. Alternatively, one or more of the packages covered by this exception can be updated to a new minor or patch release to avoid major disruptions in stable releases. This should be up to the package maintainers discretion as long as the versions follow regular Ubuntu policies ensuring we are not breaking any upgrade paths. Namely, when taking this (**3b**) path, you **must** ensure either that all stable Ubuntu releases get upgraded to the same upstream package version, or that the upstream version of the package being upgraded in a stable series **X** is not greater than the package being introduced in any stable series greater than **X**. Moreover, for the latter case, you must also ensure that there are no known regressions from the version present in one stable series to the version present in the next stable series (e.g., there are no known bugs fixed in **X-1** and not fixed in **X**).

We will reuse the upgrade bug for the SRU but this does not include
detailed test case or regression potential sections (it should link to
this page for the sake of the SRU team member doing the review!).

**Note that, for sections 3a and 3b above, when the new package versions
are fixing any CVEs, we should sync with the security team and perform
the uploads through the security pocket instead.**

QA
--

As hinted above, we will not do amazingly extensive QA. The package has
a basic autopkgtest which catches gross breakages and in practice has
caught most packaging issues so far (the only problem I am aware of it
missing is a problem in containerd on arm64 because we did not run
autopkgtests on arm64 at the time).

There is also an autopkgtest that exercises "docker in lxd" as described
in
https://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/04/13/stephane-graber-lxd-2-0-docker-in-lxd-712/
. on autopkgtests.

This QA should happen both for the -proposed -> -release migration in
the devel series and again as part of the SRU verification.

.. _record_of_regressions:

Record of regressions
---------------------

According to `LP:
#1939106 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/docker.io/+bug/1939106>`__,
upstream removed support for the aufs storage driver. This broke users
in August 2021, but this breakage was explicitly permitted by this
policy as it was written at the time. The deprecation notice was stated
in Docker Engine 18.09 see
https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/18.09/#deprecation-notices
(2019-09-03).

In `LP:
#1968035 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/docker-buildx/+bug/1968035>`__,
upstream has changed the requirements to run the new buildsystem
\`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build .\`. In the new version, the new
buildsystem requires \`docker-buildx\` which was not included in the
SRU.

`LP:
#2098106 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/docker.io-app/+bug/2098106>`__:
regression affecting Launchpad OCI builds
