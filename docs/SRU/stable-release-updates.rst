Stable Release Updates (SRU)
============================

.. A single sentence that says what the product is, succinctly and
   memorably.

**Stable release updates** (SRUs) are package updates to a currently supported Ubuntu release.

.. A paragraph of one to three short sentences, that describe what the
   product does.

Once an Ubuntu release has been completed and published, updates for it
are only **released under certain circumstances**, and must follow **a special
procedure** called SRU.

.. A third paragraph of similar length, this time explaining what need the
   product meets.

The SRU principles and processes ensure that stable Ubuntu releases **remain stable
and predictable** to the user.

.. Finally, a paragraph that describes whom the product is useful for.

This documentation is intended for **all Ubuntu users** if
they wish to understand what to expect from Ubuntu stable releases, and
also for **upstream and Ubuntu developers** if they wish to
understand what changes would or would not be acceptable to us. The rest
is intended for **Ubuntu developers and SRU team members** to achieve this
in practice.

    Did you **notice a regression** in a package that went to the ``-updates`` pocket?
    Please report this by following :ref:`howto-report-regression`.

Learn how Canonical determines which updates qualify for SRUs, who supervises the update process, who contributes and what responsibilities they have.

Processes
---------

You must follow these rules when you upload a package update. Processes such as automatic tests, phasing and user reports prevent regressions in updates. Certain exceptions to standard processes are possible.
