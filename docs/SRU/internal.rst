Internal SRU team docs
======================

Decision making
---------------

-  Act for the team if you're confident that the team would concur
-  If unsure, ask, and if you need to follow up, add to the SRU team
   meeting agenda where we can make a team decision

Reviewing procedure and tools
-----------------------------

If you are a member of the `SRU reviewing team <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sru>`__,
you should check out the `ubuntu-archive-tools <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-archive-tools>`__
scripts with

.. code::

   git clone https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-archive-tools

which greatly simplifies the reviewing procedure. You should symlink
``sru-review`` and ``sru-accept`` somewhere to your ``~/bin/`` directory for easy
access, or put the checkout into your ``$PATH``.

The following review procedure is recommended:

-  Open the unapproved queue for a particular release, e.g.
   `Upload queue <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+queue?queue_state=1>`__
   for noble. This shows the list of SRU uploads which have to be
   reviewed, commented on, and approved/accepted/rejected.
-  For each package, generate the debdiff to the current version in the
   archive and open the corresponding bugs:

   .. code::

      sru-review -s noble gnash

   This opens all the bugs which are mentioned in the .changes file in
   the browser, and will generate a debdiff between the current archive
   and the unapproved upload (unless the ``orig.tar.gz`` changes this will
   only download the two ``diff.gz``, so it is reasonably fast).

   -  In case the SRU is a package sync instead of a standard upload,
      the ``sru-review`` tool will not be able to fetch the debdiff for you
      and will exit with an error. You will have to review the changes
      manually and then re-run the tool with an additional argument of
      ``--no-diff``.

-  Review the bugs for complete description, justification, check that
   they have a stable release task, conform to SRU rules, etc,
   and comment accordingly.
-  Scrutinise the debdiff for matching the changes in the bugs, not
   having unrelated changes, etc. If you have doubts, comment on the
   bug.
-  *If you are in the ubuntu-sru team:*

   -  Exit the tool you are using to review the debdiff
   -  If the bugs and debdiff are okay, accept the package by pressing :kbd:`y`
      at the "Accept the package into -proposed?" prompt.
      This will tag the bug(s) with verification-needed,
      verification-needed-$RELEASE, subscribe ubuntu-sru, and add a
      general "please test and give feedback"-like comment.
   -  If the upload is broken or unsuitable for an SRU, reject it by
      pressing N at the "Accept the package into -proposed?" prompt and
      pressing y at the "REJECT the package from -proposed?" prompt.

-  *If you are not in the ubuntu-sru team:* Send a follow up comment to
   the bugs:

   -  If all is okay: send an "ubuntu-sru approved and reviewed" comment
      and set the task to "In Progress"
   -  If something is wrong: send the feedback to the bug and set the
      task to "Incomplete"

The `pending SRUs <http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru>`__ should
also be reviewed to see whether or not there are any to be released or
removed from the archive. The process for dealing with these follows:

Packages in -proposed can be moved to -updates once they are approved by
someone from sru-verification, and have passed the minimum ageing period
of **7 days**. Use the ``sru-release`` script from ubuntu-archive-tools for
this:

.. code::

   $ ./sru-release noble kdebase

Please see ``--help``, you can also use this tool to copy packages to
-security and to the current development release. N.B. before copying a
package to -security ping a member of the
`ubuntu-security <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+members>`__
team.

-  `Currently pending SRUs <http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html>`__

If a package should be removed from -proposed, use the ``remove-package``
tool (from ``ubuntu-archive-tools``). e.g., to remove source and binaries
for the ``libreoffice`` package currently in ``xenial-proposed``:

.. code::

   $ ./remove-package -m "SRU abandoned (verification-failed)" \
     -s noble-proposed libreoffice

.. _internal-override-phasing:

Override phasing
----------------

*Overriding phasing can only be performed by a member of the SRU team.*

Overriding halted phasing is done in a similar way to overriding
autopkgtest failures. The phased update machinery looks at
`phased-update-overrides.txt <https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sru/ubuntu-archive-tools/phased-update-overrides/view/head:/phased-updates-overrides.txt>`__,
which is a simple CSV file containing lines of the form

.. code::

   *source package*, *version*, *THING_TO_IGNORE*

where ``*THING_TO_IGNORE*`` can either be an
errors.ubuntu.com problem URL to ignore or *increased-rate*.

If there are multiple errors to ignore, just repeat the line with the same source package name, version, and then the other error to ignore.

To make a change, please create a ``bzr`` merge proposal against `lp:~ubuntu-sru/ubuntu-archive-tools/phased-update-overrides <https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sru/ubuntu-archive-tools/phased-update-overrides>`__.

Etiquette for Reviewing Your Own SRU
------------------------------------

The important principle is that each stage of the SRU process should be reviewed by two
qualified people. When **accepting** a package into -proposed, this means (1) a person
who sponsored or uploaded their own work to the unapproved queue, and (2) an SRU team
member who reviews the upload in unapproved before accepting it into -proposed. When **releasing**
a package to -updates, this means (1) one person who performed the SRU verification, and
(2) an SRU team member who has reviewed the verification, and confirmed it follows the agreed
test plan etc.

Examples of permissible scenarios include:

- An SRU team member may release an SRU that they sponsored or uploaded, provided (a) the SRU was
  reviewed in unapproved by a different SRU team member, and (b) the SRU verification was performed
  by a different person.

- Two SRU team members (or one SRU team member and another uploader) may upload, accept, verify, and
  release an SRU, provided they **both** approve each step.

Examples of unacceptable scenarios include:

- An SRU team member must not accept their own upload from unapproved

- An SRU team member must not release an SRU for which they performed SRU verification


Adding members to the team
--------------------------

Onboarding
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Existing SRU team members identify when new team members are needed.
   Suggestions can be made, but ultimately the SRU team members will privately
   identify and acknowledge candidates.

-  To join the team a candidate first becomes an SRU Assistant (formerly
   sometimes called trainee). This requires the usual full time commitment,
   but not yet any privileges.

-  In that state one existing team member will onboard a given new assistant,
   "sponsoring" privileged SRU actions such as review accept and release.

-  After an initial training session this is usually done by fully shadowing
   and assisting in the shift of that existing team member being their mentor.

-  This mentor will confer with the other existing team members if and when
   they consider the assistant to be ready for full membership:

   - One existing team member will study a candidate's recent SRU activity,
     assess them against our criteria and write a summary.

   - The team will then decide whether the candidate is suitable.

- Once agreed the assistant will be given equivalent privileges, stop shadowing,
  and get assigned their own shift.


Criteria for new SRU team members
---------------------------------

Hard requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Must be able to upload all SRUs they expect to review; i.e. Ubuntu
   Core Developer or SRU Developer. A member of the SRU team who is an
   SRU Developer is expected to be in the process of applying to be an
   Ubuntu Core Developer: the role involves exercising judgement about
   whether a change in the development series is **good**, and therefore
   someone in this role should be formally trusted by the project to
   make such decisions for the development series as well.

-  Recent track record of good quality SRUs.

-  Recent uploads (whether sponsored or not) either met our expectations
   or successfully anticipated concerns that could reasonably have been
   predicted by existing SRU team members.

-  Few recent poor quality SRUs (nice to have: none). This includes
   uploads for issues that are unsuitable for SRU, as well as missing
   SRU information, missing bug references, poorly completed SRU
   information, etc. Exception: if an omission or concern is called out
   by the uploader and the upload was for the purpose of asking the SRU
   team about it.

-  Can they say no?

Nice to haves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Demonstrated familiarity **across** existing SRU policies and
   procedures (rather than just having correctly submitted good SRUs
   that might be limited in parts of SRU policy and procedure that they
   exercise)

-  What about SRUs they've sponsored: do they successfully raise the
   quality of SRU submissions to our expected level before they sponsor
   them? If so, then this might be a good indicator that they'll be able
   to do similar at SRU review time.

-  Do they have a track record of spotting issues before they occur? How
   broadly do they look when determining "Where problems could occur"?
   Do they then make sure the Test Plan covers identified risks?

-  Do they seek to change general policy when appropriate, rather than
   ignoring it? Can they identify the difference between individual
   exceptions and the general case?

-  Previous activity as an SRU representative helps a lot to pick up most of
   these aspects ahead of time as well as building a better general
   understanding and a personal relationship with the existing SRU team.
