Get an SRU released from proposed
---------------------------------

The Stable Release Updates team regularly checks for SRUs that have
successfully completed verification (all bugs are marked
verification-done-$RELEASE for the given release) and releases those to
the -updates pocket. Having said that, if there is a priority SRU
waiting in the unapproved queue for release to -proposed, or needing
release to -updates from -proposed, feel free to :ref:`contact an SRU
vanguard <howto-contact>`.

Please note that SRUs will not be published to the -updates pocket on
Friday (or Saturday or Sunday). Any exception will need justification.
