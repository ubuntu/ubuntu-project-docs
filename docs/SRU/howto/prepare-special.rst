Prepare a special type of SRU
-----------------------------

1. If your special type of SRU already has :ref:`package-specific notes
   <reference-package-specific-notes>` then follow :ref:`How-to →
   Perform a standard SRU <howto-perform-standard-sru>` as modified by
   those notes instead.
2. Some special types of SRU have specific how-to guides to follow instead:

   1. :ref:`Stage an upload <howto-stage-upload>`
   2. :ref:`Remove a package <howto-remove-package>`

3. Consider :ref:`Reference → Special types of SRU
   <reference-special-types-of-sru>` to try to find existing documented
   patterns for what you wish to achieve.
4. Consider :ref:`Reference → Requirements → What is acceptable to SRU
   <reference-what-is-acceptable-to-sru>` and ensure that your goal is
   compliant with our policy.
5. If you are looking to update packages using a special type of SRU on
   a routine basis, follow :ref:`How-to → Request a package-specific
   non-standard process
   <howto-request-package-specific-non-standard-process>` instead.
