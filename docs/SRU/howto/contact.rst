   generally not appropriate for communicating with the SRU team, unless
   exceptionally you must communicate confidential information such as customer
   or partner specifics.

   If you are involved in Ubuntu development, Canonical's Ubuntu Engineering
   policy requires you to be available on the appropriate public Ubuntu
   development channels during your usual working hours.
