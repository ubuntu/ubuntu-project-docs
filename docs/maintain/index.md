# How to maintain Ubuntu

In general, this should probably be split *by task* and then ordered by either
increasing permissions required (i.e. from lowest to highest), or by
frequency (i.e. most common tasks first)

Every section here will cover multiple processes or tasks. Each should have a
corresponding explainer in the "how Ubuntu is made" section, and if there are
things that the person needs to know to carry these things out (process
exceptions, etc) they should be in the "ubuntu roles/responsibilities" section
(e.g. MIR exceptions and special cases).
