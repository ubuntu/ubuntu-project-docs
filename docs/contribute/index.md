# How to contribute

## Getting set up

This section includes all the relevant tooling you'll need to work on Ubuntu.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

index-setup
```

## Documentation

This section should also link to Community + CODA content
```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

Contribute to documentation <contribute-docs>
```

## Bug fixing

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

index-bug-fix
```


## Patching

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

index-patching
```

This should also probably be the path into SRU docs

## New packages

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

index-new-package
```

Should also discuss backports?

## Main Inclusion Review

The {ref}`Main Inclusion Review (MIR) <main-inclusion-review>` process ensures
that both **reporters** and **reviewers** can successfully handle `main`
inclusion requests. This improves the long-term maintainability of the packages 
in `main`.
